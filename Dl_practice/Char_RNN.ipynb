davis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmajor-general henry ronald douglas maciver\\n\\nany sunny afternoon, on fifth avenue, or at night in the _table d’hote_\\nrestaurants of university place, you may meet the soldier of fortune who\\nof all his brothers in arms now living is the most remarkable. you may\\nhave noticed him; a stiffly erect, distinguished-looking man, with gray\\nhair, an imperial of the fashion of louis napoleon, fierce blue eyes,\\nand across his forehead a sabre cut.\\n\\nthis is henry ronald douglas maciver, for some time in india an ensign\\nin the sepoy mutiny; in italy, lieutenant under garibaldi; in spain,\\ncaptain under don carlos; in our civil war, major in the confederate\\narmy; in mexico, lieutenant-colonel under the emperor maximilian;\\ncolonel under napoleon iii, inspector of cavalry for the khedive of\\negypt, and chief of cavalry and general of brigade of the army of king\\nmilan of servia. these are only a few of his military titles. in 1884\\nwas published a book giving the story of his life up to that year. it\\nwas called “under fourteen flags.” if to-day general maciver were to\\nreprint the book, it would be called “under eighteen flags.”\\n\\nmaciver was born on christmas day, 1841, at sea, a league off the shore\\nof virginia. his mother was miss anna douglas of that state; ronald\\nmaciver, his father, was a scot, a rossshire gentleman, a younger son of\\nthe chief of the clan maciver. until he was ten years old young maciver\\nplayed in virginia at the home of his father. then, in order that he\\nmight be educated, he was shipped to edinburgh to an uncle, general\\ndonald graham. after five years his uncle obtained for him a commission\\nas ensign in the honorable east india company, and at sixteen, when\\nother boys are preparing for college, maciver was in the indian mutiny,\\nfighting, not for a flag, nor a country, but as one fights a wild\\nanimal, for his life. he was wounded in the arm, and, with a sword, cut\\nover the head. as a safeguard against the sun the boy had placed inside\\nhis helmet a wet towel. this saved him to fight another day, but even\\nwith that protection the sword sank through the helmet, the towel, and\\ninto the skull. to-day you can see the scar. he was left in the road\\nfor dead, and even after his wounds had healed, was six weeks in the\\nhospital.\\n\\nthis tough handling at the very start might have satisfied some men, but\\nin the very next war maciver was a volunteer and wore the red shirt of\\ngaribaldi. he remained at the front throughout that campaign, and until\\nwithin a few years there has been no campaign of consequence in which he\\nhas not taken part. he served in the ten years’ war in cuba, in\\nbrazil, in argentina, in crete, in greece, twice in spain in carlist\\nrevolutions, in bosnia, and for four years in our civil war under\\ngenerals jackson and stuart around richmond. in this great war he was\\nfour times wounded.\\n\\nit was after the surrender of the confederate army, that, with other\\nsouthern officers, he served under maximilian in mexico; in egypt, and\\nin france. whenever in any part of the world there was fighting, or the\\nrumor of fighting, the procedure of the general invariably was the\\nsame. he would order himself to instantly depart for the front, and on\\narriving there would offer to organize a foreign legion. the command of\\nthis organization always was given to him. but the foreign legion was\\nmerely the entering wedge. he would soon show that he was fitted for\\na better command than a band of undisciplined volunteers, and would\\nreceive a commission in the regular army. in almost every command in\\nwhich he served that is the manner in which promotion came. sometimes he\\nsaw but little fighting, sometimes he should have died several deaths,\\neach of a nature more unpleasant than the others. for in war the obvious\\ndanger of a bullet is but a three hundred to one shot, while in the pack\\nagainst the combatant the jokers are innumerable. and in the career of\\nthe general the unforeseen adventures are the most interesting. a man\\nwho in eighteen campaigns has played his part would seem to have\\nearned exemption from any other risks, but often it was outside the\\nbattle-field that maciver encountered the greatest danger. he fought\\nseveral duels, in two of which he killed his adversary; several attempts\\nwere made to assassinate him, and while on his way to mexico he was\\ncaptured by hostile indians. on returning from an expedition in cuba he\\nwas cast adrift in an open boat and for days was without food.\\n\\nlong before i met general maciver i had read his book and had heard of\\nhim from many men who had met him in many different lands while\\nengaged in as many different undertakings. several of the older war\\ncorrespondents knew him intimately; bennett burleigh of the _telegraph_\\nwas his friend, and e. f. knight of the _times_ was one of those who\\nvolunteered for a filibustering expedition which maciver organized\\nagainst new guinea. the late colonel ochiltree of texas told me tales\\nof maciver’s bravery, when as young men they were fellow officers in the\\nsouthern army, and stephen bonsal had met him when maciver was united\\nstates consul at denia in spain. when maciver arrived at this post, the\\nex-consul refused to vacate the consulate, and maciver wished to settle\\nthe difficulty with duelling pistols. as denia is a small place, the\\ninhabitants feared for their safety, and bonsal, who was our _charge\\nd’affaires_ then, was sent from madrid to adjust matters. without\\nbloodshed he got rid of the ex-consul, and later maciver so endeared\\nhimself to the denians that they begged the state department to retain\\nhim in that place for the remainder of his life.\\n\\nbefore general maciver was appointed to a high position at the st. louis\\nfair, i saw much of him in new york. his room was in a side street in\\nan old-fashioned boarding-house, and overlooked his neighbor’s back yard\\nand a typical new york city sumac tree; but when the general talked one\\nforgot he was within a block of the elevated, and roamed over all\\nthe world. on his bed he would spread out wonderful parchments, with\\nstrange, heathenish inscriptions, with great seals, with faded ribbons.\\nthese were signed by sultans, secretaries of war, emperors, filibusters.\\nthey were military commissions, titles of nobility, brevets for\\ndecorations, instructions and commands from superior officers.\\ntranslated the phrases ran: “imposing special confidence in,” “we\\nappoint,” or “create,” or “declare,” or “in recognition of services\\nrendered to our person,” or “country,” or “cause,” or “for bravery on\\nthe field of battle we bestow the cross----”\\n\\nas must a soldier, the general travels “light,” and all his worldly\\npossessions were crowded ready for mobilization into a small compass. he\\nhad his sword, his field blanket, his trunk, and the tin despatch\\nboxes that held his papers. from these, like a conjurer, he would draw\\nsouvenirs of all the world. from the embrace of faded letters, he would\\nunfold old photographs, daguerrotypes, and miniatures of fair women and\\nadventurous men: women who now are queens in exile, men who, lifted on\\nwaves of absinthe, still, across a _cafe_ table, tell how they will win\\nback a crown.\\n\\nonce in a written document the general did me the honor to appoint me\\nhis literary executor, but as he is young, and as healthy as myself, it\\nnever may be my lot to perform such an unwelcome duty. and to-day all\\none can write of him is what the world can read in “under fourteen\\nflags,” and some of the “foot-notes to history” which i have copied\\nfrom his scrap-book. this scrap-book is a wonderful volume, but owing\\nto “political” and other reasons, for the present, of the many clippings\\nfrom newspapers it contains there are only a few i am at liberty to\\nprint. and from them it is difficult to make a choice. to sketch in a\\nfew thousand words a career that had developed under eighteen flags is\\nin its very wealth embarrassing.\\n\\nhere is one story, as told by the scrap-book, of an expedition that\\nfailed. that it failed was due to a british cabinet minister; for had\\nlord derby possessed the imagination of the soldier of fortune, his\\nmajesty’s dominions might now be the richer by many thousands of square\\nmiles and many thousands of black subjects.\\n\\non october 29, 1883, the following appeared in the london _standard_:\\n“the new guinea exploration and colonization company is already\\nchartered, and the first expedition expects to leave before christmas.”\\n “the prospectus states settlers intending to join the first party must\\ncontribute one hundred pounds toward the company. this subscription will\\ninclude all expenses for passage money. six months’ provisions will be\\nprovided, together with tents and arms for protection. each subscriber\\nof one hundred pounds is to obtain a certificate entitling him to one\\nthousand acres.”\\n\\nthe view of the colonization scheme taken by the _times_ of london, of\\nthe same date, is less complaisant. “the latest commercial sensation is\\na proposed company for the seizure of new guinea. certain adventurous\\ngentlemen are looking out for one hundred others who have money and\\na taste for buccaneering. when the company has been completed, its\\nshare-holders are to place themselves under military regulations, sail\\nin a body for new guinea, and without asking anybody’s leave, seize\\nupon the island and at once, in some unspecified way, proceed to realize\\nlarge profits. if the idea does not suggest comparisons with the large\\ndesigns of sir francis drake, it is at least not unworthy of captain\\nkidd.”\\n\\nwhen we remember the manner in which some of the colonies of great\\nbritain were acquired, the _times_ seems almost squeamish.\\n\\nin a melbourne paper, june, 1884, is the following paragraph:\\n\\n“toward the latter part of 1883 the government of queensland planted the\\nflag of great britain on the shores of new guinea. when the news reached\\nengland it created a sensation. the earl of derby, secretary for the\\ncolonies, refused, however, to sanction the annexation of new\\nguinea, and in so doing acted contrary to the sincere wish of every\\nright-thinking anglo-saxon under the southern cross.\\n\\n“while the subsequent correspondence between the home and queensland\\ngovernments was going on, brigadier-general h. r. maciver originated and\\norganized the new guinea exploration and colonization company in london,\\nwith a view to establishing settlements on the island. the company,\\npresided over by general beresford of the british army, and having\\nan eminently representative and influential board of directors, had a\\ncapital of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and placed the\\nsupreme command of the expedition in the hands of general maciver.\\nnotwithstanding the character of the gentlemen composing the board of\\ndirectors, and the truly peaceful nature of the expedition, his lordship\\ninformed general maciver that in the event of the latter’s attempting to\\nland on new guinea, instructions would be sent to the officer in command\\nof her majesty’s fleet in the western pacific to fire upon the company’s\\nvessel. this meant that the expedition would be dealt with as a\\nfilibustering one.”\\n\\nin _judy_, september 21, 1887, appears:\\n\\n“we all recollect the treatment received by brigadier-general maci. in\\nthe action he took with respect to the annexation of new guinea. the\\ngeneral, who is a sort of pizarro, with a dash of d’artagnan, was\\ntreated in a most scurvy manner by lord derby. had maciver not been\\nthwarted in his enterprise, the whole of new guinea would now have been\\nunder the british flag, and we should not be cheek-by-jowl with the\\ngermans, as we are in too many places.”\\n\\n_society_, september 3, 1887, says:\\n\\n“the new guinea expedition proved abortive, owing to the blundering\\nshortsightedness of the then government, for which lord derby was\\nchiefly responsible, but what little foothold we possess in new guinea,\\nis certainly due to general maciver’s gallant effort.”\\n\\ncopy of statement made by j. rintoul mitchell, june 2, 1887:\\n\\n“about the latter end of the year 1883, when i was editor-in-chief of\\nthe _englishman_ in calcutta, i was told by captain de deaux, assistant\\nsecretary in the foreign office of the indian government, that he\\nhad received a telegram from lord derby to the effect that if general\\nmaciver ventured to land upon the coast of new guinea it would become\\nthe duty of lord ripon, viceroy, to use the naval forces at his command\\nfor the purpose of deporting general maci. sir aucland calvin can\\ncertify to this, as it was discussed in the viceregal council.”\\n\\njust after our civil war maciver was interested in another expedition\\nwhich also failed. its members called themselves the knights of arabia,\\nand their object was to colonize an island much nearer to our shores\\nthan new guinea. maciver, saying that his oath prevented, would never\\ntell me which island this was, but the reader can choose from\\namong cuba, haiti, and the hawaiian group. to have taken cuba, the\\n“colonizers” would have had to fight not only spain, but the cubans\\nthemselves, on whose side they were soon fighting in the ten years’ war;\\nso cuba may be eliminated. and as the expedition was to sail from the\\natlantic side, and not from san francisco, the island would appear to be\\nthe black republic. from the records of the times it would seem that the\\ngreater number of the knights of arabia were veterans of the confederate\\narmy, and there is no question but that they intended to subjugate the\\nblacks of haiti and form a republic for white men in which slavery would\\nbe recognized. as one of the leaders of this filibustering expedition,\\nmaciver was arrested by general phil sheridan and for a short time cast\\ninto jail.\\n\\nthis chafed the general’s spirit, but he argued philosophically that\\nimprisonment for filibustering, while irksome, brought with it\\nno reproach. and, indeed, sometimes the only difference between a\\nfilibuster and a government lies in the fact that the government fights\\nthe gun-boats of only the enemy while a filibuster must dodge the boats\\nof the enemy and those of his own countrymen. when the united states\\nwent to war with spain there were many men in jail as filibusters, for\\ndoing that which at the time the country secretly approved, and later\\nimitated. and because they attempted exactly the same thing for which\\ndr. jameson was imprisoned in holloway jail, two hundred thousand of his\\ncountrymen are now wearing medals.\\n\\nthe by-laws of the knights of arabia leave but little doubt as to its\\nobject.\\n\\nby-law no. ii reads:\\n\\n“we, as knights of arabia, pledge ourselves to aid, comfort, and protect\\nall knights of arabia, especially those who are wounded in obtaining our\\ngrand object.\\n\\n“iii--great care must be taken that no unbeliever or outsider shall gain\\nany insight into the mysteries or secrets of the order.\\n\\n“iv--the candidate will have to pay one hundred dollars cash to\\nthe captain of the company, and the candidate will receive from the\\nsecretary a knight of arabia bond for one hundred dollars in gold, with\\nten per cent interest, payable ninety days after the recognition of (the\\nrepublic of----) by the united states, or any government.\\n\\n“v--all knights of arabia will be entitled to one hundred acres of\\nland, location of said land to be drawn for by lottery. the products are\\ncoffee, sugar, tobacco, and cotton.”\\n\\na local correspondent of the new york _herald_ writes of the arrest of\\nmaciver as follows:\\n\\n“when maciver will be tried is at present unknown, as his case has\\nassumed a complicated aspect. he claims british protection as a subject\\nof her british majesty, and the english consul has forwarded a statement\\nof his case to sir frederick bruce at washington, accompanied by a copy\\nof the by-laws. general sheridan also has forwarded a statement to\\nthe secretary of war, accompanied not only by the by-laws, but very\\nimportant documents, including letters from jefferson davis, benjamin,\\nthe secretary of state of the confederate states, and other personages\\nprominent in the rebellion, showing that maciver enjoyed the highest\\nconfidence of the confederacy.”\\n\\nas to the last statement, an open letter i found in his scrap-book is an\\nexcellent proof. it is as follows: “to officers and members of all camps\\nof united confederate veterans: it affords me the greatest pleasure to\\nsay that the bearer of this letter, general henry ronald maciver, was an\\nofficer of great gallantry in the confederate army, serving on the staff\\nat various times of general stonewall jackson, j. e. b. stuart, and e.\\nkirby smith, and that his official record is one of which any man may be\\nproud.\\n\\n“respectfully, marcus j. wright, “_agent for the collection of\\nconfederate records_.\\n\\n“war records office, war department, washington, july 8, 1895.”\\n\\nat the close of the war duels between officers of the two armies were\\nnot infrequent. in the scrap-book there is the account of one of these\\naffairs sent from vicksburg to a northern paper by a correspondent who\\nwas an eye-witness of the event. it tells how major maciver, accompanied\\nby major gillespie, met, just outside of vicksburg, captain tomlin of\\nvermont, of the united states artillery volunteers. the duel was with\\nswords. maciver ran tomlin through the body. the correspondent writes:\\n\\n“the confederate officer wiped his sword on his handkerchief. in a few\\nseconds captain tomlin expired. one of major maciver’s seconds called to\\nhim: ‘he is dead; you must go. these gentlemen will look after the body\\nof their friend.’ a negro boy brought up the horses, but before mounting\\nmaciver said to captain tomlin’s seconds: ‘my friends are in haste for\\nme to go. is there anything i can do? i hope you consider that this\\nmatter has been settled honorably?’\\n\\n“there being no reply, the confederates rode away.”\\n\\nin a newspaper of to-day so matter-of-fact an acceptance of an event so\\ntragic would make strange reading.\\n\\nfrom the south maciver crossed through texas to join the royalist army\\nunder the emperor maximilian. it was while making his way, with other\\nconfederate officers, from galveston to el paso, that maciver was\\ncaptured by the indians. he was not ill-treated by them, but for three\\nmonths was a prisoner, until one night, the indians having camped near\\nthe rio grande, he escaped into mexico. there he offered his sword to\\nthe royalist commander, general mejia, who placed him on his staff, and\\nshowed him some few skirmishes. at monterey maciver saw big fighting,\\nand for his share in it received the title of count, and the order of\\nguadaloupe. in june, contrary to all rules of civilized war, maximilian\\nwas executed and the empire was at an end. maciver escaped to the coast,\\nand from tampico took a sailing vessel to rio de janeiro. two months\\nlater he was wearing the uniform of another emperor, dom pedro, and,\\nwith the rank of lieutenant-colonel, was in command of the foreign\\nlegion of the armies of brazil and argentina, which at that time as\\nallies were fighting against paraguay.\\n\\nmaciver soon recruited seven hundred men, but only half of these ever\\nreached the front. in buenos ayres cholera broke out and thirty thousand\\npeople died, among the number about half the legion. maciver was among\\nthose who suffered, and before he recovered was six weeks in hospital.\\nduring that period, under a junior officer, the foreign legion was sent\\nto the front, where it was disbanded.\\n\\non his return to glasgow, maciver foregathered with an old friend,\\nbennett burleigh, whom he had known when burleigh was a lieutenant\\nin the navy of the confederate states. although today known as a\\ndistinguished war correspondent, in those days burleigh was something of\\na soldier of fortune himself, and was organizing an expedition to assist\\nthe cretan insurgents against the turks. between the two men it was\\narranged that maciver should precede the expedition to crete and\\nprepare for its arrival. the cretans received him gladly, and from the\\nprovisional government he received a commission in which he was given\\n“full power to make war on land and sea against the enemies of crete,\\nand particularly against the sultan of turkey and the turkish forces,\\nand to burn, destroy, or capture any vessel bearing the turkish flag.”\\n\\nthis permission to destroy the turkish navy single-handed strikes one\\nas more than generous, for the cretans had no navy, and before one could\\nbegin the destruction of a turkish gun-boat it was first necessary to\\ncatch it and tie it to a wharf.\\n\\nat the close of the cretan insurrection maciver crossed to athens and\\nserved against the brigands in kisissia on the borders of albania\\nand thessaly as volunteer aide to colonel corroneus, who had been\\ncommander-in-chief of the cretans against the turks. maciver spent three\\nmonths potting at brigands, and for his services in the mountains was\\nrecommended for the highest greek decoration.\\n\\nfrom greece it was only a step to new york, and almost immediately\\nmaciver appears as one of the goicouria-christo expedition to cuba,\\nof which goicouria was commander-in-chief, and two famous american\\nofficers, brigadier-general samuel c. williams was a general and colonel\\nwright schumburg was chief of staff.\\n\\nin the scrap-book i find “general order no. 11 of the liberal army of\\nthe republic of cuba, issued at cedar keys, october 3, 1869.” in it\\ncolonel maciver is spoken of as in charge of officers not attached to\\nany organized corps of the division. and again:\\n\\n“general order no. v, expeditionary division, republic of cuba, on board\\n_lilian_,” announces that the place to which the expedition is bound has\\nbeen changed, and that general wright schumburg, who now is in command,\\norders “all officers not otherwise commissioned to join colonel\\nmaciver’s ‘corps of officers.’”\\n\\nthe _lilian_ ran out of coal, and to obtain firewood put in at cedar\\nkeys. for two weeks the patriots cut wood and drilled upon the beach,\\nwhen they were captured by a british gun-boat and taken to nassau.\\nthere they were set at liberty, but their arms, boat, and stores were\\nconfiscated.\\n\\nin a sailing vessel maciver finally reached cuba, and under goicouria,\\nwho had made a successful landing, saw some “help yourself” fighting.\\ngoicouria’s force was finally scattered, and maciver escaped from the\\nspanish soldiery only by putting to sea in an open boat, in which he\\nendeavored to make jamaica.\\n\\non the third day out he was picked up by a steamer and again landed at\\nnassau, from which place he returned to new york.\\n\\nat that time in this city there was a very interesting man named\\nthaddeus p. mott, who had been an officer in our army and later\\nhad entered the service of ismail pasha. by the khedive he had\\nbeen appointed a general of division and had received permission to\\nreorganize the egyptian army.\\n\\nhis object in coming to new york was to engage officers for that\\nservice. he came at an opportune moment. at that time the city was\\nfilled with men who, in the rebellion, on one side or the other, had\\nheld command, and many of these, unfitted by four years of soldiering\\nfor any other calling, readily accepted the commissions which mott had\\nauthority to offer. new york was not large enough to keep maciver and\\nmott long apart, and they soon came to an understanding. the agreement\\ndrawn up between them is a curious document. it is written in a neat\\nhand on sheets of foolscap tied together like a commencement-day\\naddress, with blue ribbon. in it maciver agrees to serve as colonel of\\ncavalry in the service of the khedive. with a few legal phrases omitted,\\nthe document reads as follows:\\n\\n“agreement entered into this 24th day of march, 1870, between the\\ngovernment of his royal highness and the khedive of egypt, represented\\nby general thaddeus p. mott of the first part, and h. r. h. maciver of\\nnew york city.\\n\\n“the party of the second part, being desirous of entering into the\\nservice of party of the first part, in the military capacity of a\\ncolonel of cavalry, promises to serve and obey party of the first part\\nfaithfully and truly in his military capacity during the space of five\\nyears from this date; that the party of the second part waives all\\nclaims of protection usually afforded to americans by consular and\\ndiplomatic agents of the united states, and expressly obligates himself\\nto be subject to the orders of the party of the first part, and to make,\\nwage, and vigorously prosecute war against any and all the enemies of\\nparty of the first part; that the party of the second part will not\\nunder any event be governed, controlled by, or submit to, any order,\\nlaw, mandate, or proclamation issued by the government of the united\\nstates of america, forbidding party of the second part to serve party\\nof the first part to make war according to any of the provisions herein\\ncontained, _it being, however, distinctly understood_ that nothing\\nherein contained shall be construed as obligating party of the second\\npart to bear arms or wage war against the united states of america.\\n\\n“party of the first part promises to furnish party of the second part\\nwith horses, rations, and pay him for his services the same salary now\\npaid to colonels of cavalry in united states army, and will furnish him\\nquarters suitable to his rank in army. also promises, in the case of\\nillness caused by climate, that said party may resign his office and\\nshall receive his expenses to america and two months’ pay; that he\\nreceives one-fifth of his regular pay during his active service,\\ntogether with all expenses of every nature attending such enterprise.”\\n\\nit also stipulates as to what sums shall be paid his family or children\\nin case of his death.\\n\\nto this maciver signs this oath:\\n\\n“in the presence of the ever-living god, i swear that i will in all\\nthings honestly, faithfully, and truly keep, observe, and perform the\\nobligations and promises above enumerated, and endeavor to conform to\\nthe wishes and desires of the government of his royal highness, the\\nkhedive of egypt, in all things connected with the furtherance of his\\nprosperity, and the maintenance of his throne.”\\n\\non arriving at cairo, maciver was appointed inspector-general of\\ncavalry, and furnished with a uniform, of which this is a description:\\n“it consisted of a blue tunic with gold spangles, embroidered in gold\\nup the sleeves and front, neat-fitting red trousers, and high\\npatent-leather boots, while the inevitable fez completed the gay\\ncostume.”\\n\\nthe climate of cairo did not agree with maciver, and, in spite of\\nhis “gay costume,” after six months he left the egyptian service. his\\nhonorable discharge was signed by stone bey, who, in the favor of the\\nkhedive, had supplanted general mott.\\n\\nit is a curious fact that, in spite of his ill health, immediately after\\nleaving cairo, maciver was sufficiently recovered to at once plunge into\\nthe franco-prussian war. at the battle of orleans, while on the staff\\nof general chanzy, he was wounded. in this war his rank was that of a\\ncolonel of cavalry of the auxiliary army.\\n\\nhis next venture was in the carlist uprising of 1873, when he formed a\\ncarlist league, and on several occasions acted as bearer of important\\nmessages from the “king,” as don carlos was called, to the sympathizers\\nwith his cause in france and england.\\n\\nmaciver was promised, if he carried out successfully a certain mission\\nupon which he was sent, and if don carlos became king, that he would be\\nmade a marquis. as don carlos is still a pretender, maciver is still a\\ngeneral. although in disposing of his sword maciver never allowed his\\npersonal predilections to weigh with him, he always treated himself to a\\nhearty dislike of the turks, and we next find him fighting against them\\nin herzegovina with the montenegrins. and when the servians declared\\nwar against the same people, maciver returned to london to organize a\\ncavalry brigade to fight with the servian army.\\n\\nof this brigade and of the rapid rise of maciver to highest rank and\\nhonors in servia, the scrap-book is most eloquent. the cavalry brigade\\nwas to be called the knights of the red cross.\\n\\nin a letter to the editor of the _hour_, the general himself speaks of\\nit in the following terms:\\n\\n“it may be interesting to many of your readers to learn that a select\\ncorps of gentlemen is at present in course of organization under\\nthe above title with the mission of proceeding to the levant to\\ntake measures in case of emergency for the defense of the christian\\npopulation, and more especially of british subjects who are to a great\\nextent unprovided with adequate means of protection from the religious\\nfuries of the mussulmans. the lives of christian women and children are\\nin hourly peril from fanatical hordes. the knights will be carefully\\nchosen and kept within strict military control, and will be under\\ncommand of a practical soldier with large experience of the eastern\\ncountries. templars and all other crusaders are invited to give aid and\\nsympathy.”\\n\\napparently maciver was not successful in enlisting many knights, for\\na war correspondent at the capital of servia, waiting for the war to\\nbegin, writes as follows:\\n\\n“a scotch soldier of fortune, henry maciver, a colonel by rank, has\\narrived at belgrade with a small contingent of military adventurers.\\nfive weeks ago i met him in fleet street, london, and had some talk\\nabout his ‘expedition.’ he had received a commission from the prince of\\nservia to organize and command an independent cavalry brigade, and he\\nthen was busily enrolling his volunteers into a body styled ‘the knights\\nof the red cross.’ i am afraid some of his bold crusaders have earned\\nmore distinction for their attacks on fleet street bars than they are\\nlikely to earn on servian battle-fields, but then i must not anticipate\\nhistory.”\\n\\nanother paper tells that at the end of the first week of his service as\\na servian officer, maciver had enlisted ninety men, but that they were\\nscattered about the town, many without shelter and rations:\\n\\n“he assembled his men on the rialto, and in spite of official\\nexpostulation, the men were marched up to the minister’s four\\nabreast--and they marched fairly well, making a good show. the war\\nminister was taken by storm, and at once granted everything. it has\\nraised the english colonel’s popularity with his men to fever heat.”\\n\\nthis from the _times_, london:\\n\\n“our belgrade correspondent telegraphs last night:\\n\\n“‘there is here at present a gentleman named maciver. he came from\\nengland to offer himself and his sword to the servians. the servian\\nminister of war gave him a colonel’s commission. this morning i saw him\\ndrilling about one hundred and fifty remarkably fine-looking fellows,\\nall clad in a good serviceable cavalry uniform, and he has horses.”’\\n\\nlater we find that:\\n\\n“colonel maciver’s legion of cavalry, organizing here, now numbers over\\ntwo hundred men.”\\n\\nand again:\\n\\n“prince nica, a roumanian cousin of the princess natalie of servia, has\\njoined colonel maciver’s cavalry corps.”\\n\\nlater, in the _court journal_, october 28, 1876, we read:\\n\\n“colonel maciver, who a few years ago was very well known in military\\ncircles in dublin, now is making his mark with the servian army. in\\nthe war against the turks, he commands about one thousand russo-servian\\ncavalry.”\\n\\nhe was next to receive the following honors:\\n\\n“colonel maciver has been appointed commander of the cavalry of the\\nservian armies on the morava and timok, and has received the cross of\\nthe takovo order from general tchemaieff for gallant conduct in the\\nfield, and the gold medal for valor.”\\n\\nlater we learn from the _daily news_:\\n\\n“mr. lewis farley, secretary of the ‘league in aid of christians of\\nturkey,’ has received the following letter, dated belgrade, october 10,\\n1876:\\n\\n“‘dear sir: in reference to the embroidered banner so kindly worked by\\nan english lady and forwarded by the league to colonel maciver, i have\\ngreat pleasure in conveying to you the following particulars. on sunday\\nmorning, the flag having been previously consecrated by the archbishop,\\nwas conducted by a guard of honor to the palace, and colonel maciver,\\nin the presence of prince milan and a numerous suite, in the name and\\non behalf of yourself and the fair donor, delivered it into the hands\\nof the princess natalie. the gallant colonel wore upon this occasion his\\nfull uniform as brigade commander and chief of cavalry of the servian\\narmy, and bore upon his breast the ‘gold cross of takovo’ which he\\nreceived after the battles of the 28th and 30th of september, in\\nrecognition of the heroism and bravery he displayed upon these eventful\\ndays. the beauty of the decoration was enhanced by the circumstances\\nof its bestowal, for on the evening of the battle of the 30th, general\\ntchernaieff approached colonel maciver, and, unclasping the cross from\\nhis own breast, placed it upon that of the colonel.\\n\\n“‘(signed.) hugh jackson,\\n\\n“‘_member of council of the league_.”\\n\\nin servia and in the servian army maciver reached what as yet is the\\nhighest point of his career, and of his life the happiest period.\\n\\nhe was _general de brigade_, which is not what we know as a brigade\\ngeneral, but is one who commands a division, a major-general. he was a\\ngreat favorite both at the palace and with the people, the pay was good,\\nfighting plentiful, and belgrade gay and amusing. of all the places\\nhe has visited and the countries he has served, it is of this balkan\\nkingdom that the general seems to speak most fondly and with the\\ngreatest feeling. of queen natalie he was and is a most loyal and\\nchivalric admirer, and was ever ready, when he found any one who did\\nnot as greatly respect the lady, to offer him the choice of swords or\\npistols. even for milan he finds an extenuating word.\\n\\nafter servia the general raised more foreign legions, planned further\\nexpeditions; in central america reorganized the small armies of the\\nsmall republics, served as united states consul, and offered his sword\\nto president mckinley for use against spain. but with servia the most\\nactive portion of the life of the general ceased, and the rest has been\\na repetition of what went before. at present his time is divided between\\nnew york and virginia, where he has been offered an executive position\\nin the approaching jamestown exposition. both north and south he has\\nmany friends, many admirers. but his life is, and, from the nature of\\nhis profession, must always be, a lonely one.\\n\\nwhile other men remain planted in one spot, gathering about them a home,\\nsons and daughters, an income for old age, maciver is a rolling stone,\\na piece of floating sea-weed; as the present king of england called him\\nfondly, “that vagabond soldier.”\\n\\nto a man who has lived in the saddle and upon transports, “neighbor”\\n conveys nothing, and even “comrade” too often means one who is no longer\\nliving.\\n\\nwith the exception of the united states, of which he now is a\\nnaturalized citizen, the general has fought for nearly every country in\\nthe world, but if any of those for which he lost his health and blood,\\nand for which he risked his life, remembers him, it makes no sign. and\\nthe general is too proud to ask to be remembered. to-day there is no\\nmore interesting figure than this man who in years is still young enough\\nto lead an army corps, and who, for forty years, has been selling his\\nsword and risking his life for presidents, pretenders, charlatans, and\\nemperors.\\n\\nhe finds some mighty changes: cuba, which he fought to free, is free;\\nmen of the south, with whom for four years he fought shoulder to\\nshoulder, are now wearing the blue; the empire of mexico, for which he\\nfought, is a republic; the empire of france, for which he fought, is a\\nrepublic; the empire of brazil, for which he fought is a republic; the\\ndynasty in servia, to which he owes his greatest honors, has been wiped\\nout by murder. from none of the eighteen countries he has served has he\\na pension, berth, or billet, and at sixty he finds himself at home in\\nevery land, but with a home in none.\\n\\nstill he has his sword, his blanket, and in the event of war, to obtain\\na commission he has only to open his tin boxes and show the commissions\\nalready won. indeed, any day, in a new uniform, and under the nineteenth\\nflag, the general may again be winning fresh victories and honors.\\n\\nand so, this brief sketch of him is left unfinished. we will mark\\nit--_to be continued_.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbaron james harden-hickey\\n\\nthis is an attempt to tell the story of baron harden-hickey, the man who\\nmade himself king, the man who was born after his time.\\n\\nif the reader, knowing something of the strange career of harden-hickey,\\nwonders why one writes of him appreciatively rather than in amusement,\\nhe is asked not to judge harden-hickey as one judges a contemporary.\\n\\nharden-hickey, in our day, was as incongruous a figure as was the\\namerican at the court of king arthur; he was as unhappily out of the\\npicture as would be cyrano de bergerac on the floor of the board\\nof trade. judged, as at the time he was judged, by writers of comic\\nparagraphs, by presidents of railroads, by amateur “statesmen” at\\nwashington, harden-hickey was a joke. to the vacant mind of the village\\nidiot, rip van winkle returning to falling water also was a joke. the\\npeople of our day had not the time to understand harden-hickey; they\\nthought him a charlatan, half a dangerous adventurer and half a fool;\\nand harden-hickey certainly did not under stand them. his last words,\\naddressed to his wife, showed this. they were: “i would rather die a\\ngentleman than live a blackguard like your father.”\\n\\nas a matter of fact, his father-in-law, although living under the\\ndisadvantage of being a standard oil magnate, neither was, nor is, a\\nblackguard, and his son-in-law had been treated by him generously\\nand with patience. but for the duellist and soldier of fortune it was\\nimpossible to sympathize with a man who took no greater risk in life\\nthan to ride on one of his own railroads, and of the views the two men\\nheld of each other, that of john h. flagler was probably the fairer and\\nthe more kindly.\\n\\nharden-hickey was one of the most picturesque, gallant, and pathetic\\nadventurers of our day; but flagler also deserves our sympathy.\\n\\nfor an unimaginative and hard-working standard oil king to have a\\nd’artagnan thrust upon him as a son-in-law must be trying.\\n\\njames a. harden-hickey, james the first of trinidad, baron of the\\nholy roman empire, was born on december 8, 1854. as to the date all\\nhistorians agree; as to where the important event took place they\\ndiffer. that he was born in france his friends are positive, but at the\\ntime of his death in el paso the san francisco papers claimed him as a\\nnative of california. all agree that his ancestors were catholics and\\nroyalists who left ireland with the stuarts when they sought refuge in\\nfrance. the version which seems to be the most probable is that he was\\nborn in san francisco, where as one of the early settlers, his father,\\ne. c. hickey, was well known, and that early in his life, in order to\\neducate him, the mother took him to europe.\\n\\nthere he was educated at the jesuit college at namur, then at leipsic,\\nand later entered the military college of st. cyr.\\n\\njames the first was one of those boys who never had the misfortune to\\ngrow up. to the moment of his death, in all he planned you can trace the\\neffects of his early teachings and environment; the influences of the\\ngreat church that nursed him, and of the city of paris, in which he\\nlived. under the second empire, paris was at her maddest, baddest, and\\nbest. to-day under the republic, without a court, with a society kept in\\nfunds by the self-expatriated wives and daughters of our business men,\\nshe lacks the reasons for which baron haussmann bedecked her and made\\nher beautiful. the good loubet, the worthy fallieres, except that they\\nfurnish the cartoonist with subjects for ridicule, do not add to the\\ngayety of paris. but when harden-hickey was a boy, paris was never so\\ncarelessly gay, so brilliant, never so overcharged with life, color, and\\nadventure.\\n\\nin those days “the emperor sat in his box that night,” and in the box\\nopposite sat cora pearl; veterans of the campaign of italy, of mexico,\\nfrom the desert fights of algiers, sipped sugar and water in front of\\ntortoni’s, the cafe durand, the cafe riche; the sidewalks rang with\\ntheir sabres, the boulevards were filled with the colors of the gorgeous\\nuniforms; all night of each night the place vendome shone with the\\ncarriage lamps of the visiting pashas from egypt, of nabobs from\\nindia, of _rastaquoueres_ from the sister empire of brazil; the state\\ncarriages, with the outriders and postilions in the green and gold of\\nthe empress, swept through the champs elysees, and at the bal bulier,\\nand at mabile the students and “grisettes” introduced the cancan. the\\nmen of those days were hugo, thiers, dumas, daudet, alfred de musset;\\nthe magnificent blackguard, the duc de morny, and the great, simple\\ncanrobert, the captain of barricades, who became a marshal of france.\\n\\nover all was the mushroom emperor, his anterooms crowded with the\\ntitled charlatans of europe, his court radiant with countesses created\\novernight. and it was the emperor, with his love of theatrical display,\\nof gorgeous ceremonies; with his restless reaching after military glory,\\nthe weary, cynical adventurer, that the boy at st. cyr took as his\\nmodel.\\n\\nroyalist as was harden-hickey by birth and tradition, and royalist as\\nhe always remained, it was the court at the tuileries that filled his\\nimagination. the bourbons, whom he served, hoped some day for a court;\\nat the tuileries there was a court, glittering before his physical eyes.\\nthe bourbons were pleasant old gentlemen, who later willingly supported\\nhim, and for whom always he was equally willing to fight, either with\\nhis sword or his pen. but to the last, in his mind, he carried pictures\\nof the second empire as he, as a boy, had known it.\\n\\ncan you not imagine the future james the first, barelegged, in a\\nblack-belted smock, halting with his nurse, or his priest, to gaze up in\\nawestruck delight at the great, red-breeched zouaves lounging on guard\\nat the tuileries?\\n\\n“when i grow up,” said little james to himself, not knowing that he\\nnever would grow up, “i shall have zouaves for _my_ palace guard.”\\n\\nand twenty years later, when he laid down the laws for his little\\nkingdom, you find that the officers of his court must wear the mustache,\\n“_a la_ louis napoleon,” and that the zouave uniform will be worn by the\\npalace guards.\\n\\nin 1883, while he still was at the war college, his father died, and\\nwhen he graduated, which he did with honors, he found himself his own\\nmaster. his assets were a small income, a perfect knowledge of the\\nfrench language, and the reputation of being one of the most expert\\nswordsman in paris. he chose not to enter the army, and instead became\\na journalist, novelist, duellist, an _habitue_ of the latin quarter and\\nthe boulevards.\\n\\nas a novelist the titles of his books suggest their quality. among\\nthem are: “un amour vendeen,” “lettres d’un yankee,” “un amour dans\\nle monde,” “memoires d’un gommeux,” “merveilleuses aventures de\\nnabuchodonosor, nosebreaker.”\\n\\nof the catholic church he wrote seriously, apparently with deep\\nconviction, with high enthusiasm. in her service as a defender of the\\nfaith he issued essays, pamphlets, “broadsides.” the opponents of the\\nchurch in paris he attacked relentlessly.\\n\\nas a reward for his championship he received the title of baron.\\n\\nin 1878, while only twenty-four, he married the countess de saint-pery,\\nby whom he had two children, a boy and a girl, and three years later\\nhe started _triboulet_. it was this paper that made him famous to “all\\nparis.”\\n\\nit was a royalist sheet, subsidized by the count de chambord and\\npublished in the interest of the bourbons. until 1888 harden-hickey was\\nits editor, and even by his enemies it must be said that he served his\\nemployers with zeal. during the seven years in which the paper amused\\nparis and annoyed the republican government, as its editor harden-hickey\\nwas involved in forty-two lawsuits, for different editorial\\nindiscretions, fined three hundred thousand francs, and was a principal\\nin countless duels.\\n\\nto his brother editors his standing interrogation was: “would you prefer\\nto meet me upon the editorial page, or in the bois de boulogne?” among\\nthose who met him in the bois were aurelien scholl, h. lavenbryon, m.\\ntaine, m. de cyon, philippe du bois, jean moreas.\\n\\nin 1888, either because, his patron the count de chambord having died,\\nthere was no more money to pay the fines, or because the patience of\\nthe government was exhausted, _triboulet_ ceased to exist, and\\nharden-hickey, claiming the paper had been suppressed and he himself\\nexiled, crossed to london.\\n\\nfrom there he embarked upon a voyage around the world, which lasted two\\nyears, and in the course of which he discovered the island kingdom of\\nwhich he was to be the first and last king. previous to his departure,\\nhaving been divorced from the countess de saint-pery, he placed his boy\\nand girl in the care of a fellow-journalist and very dear friend, the\\ncount de la boissiere, of whom later we shall hear more.\\n\\nharden-hickey started around the world on the _astoria_, a british\\nmerchant vessel bound for india by way of cape horn, captain jackson\\ncommanding.\\n\\nwhen off the coast of brazil the ship touched at the uninhabited island\\nof trinidad. historians of james the first say that it was through\\nstress of weather that the _astoria_ was driven to seek refuge there,\\nbut as, for six months of the year, to make a landing on the island is\\nalmost impossible, and as at any time, under stress of weather, trinidad\\nwould be a place to avoid, it is more likely jackson put in to replenish\\nhis water-casks, or to obtain a supply of turtle meat.\\n\\nor it may have been that, having told harden-hickey of the derelict\\nisland, the latter persuaded the captain to allow him to land and\\nexplore it. of this, at least, we are certain, a boat was sent ashore,\\nharden-hickey went ashore in it, and before he left the island, as a\\npiece of no man’s land, belonging to no country, he claimed it in his\\nown name, and upon the beach raised a flag of his own design.\\n\\nthe island of trinidad claimed by harden-hickey must not be confused\\nwith the larger trinidad belonging to great britain and lying off\\nvenezuela.\\n\\nthe english trinidad is a smiling, peaceful spot of great tropical\\nbeauty; it is one of the fairest places in the west indies. at every\\nhour of the year the harbor of port of spain holds open its arms to\\nvessels of every draught. a governor in a pith helmet, a cricket club, a\\nbishop in gaiters, and a botanical garden go to make it a prosperous\\nand contented colony. but the little derelict trinidad, in latitude\\n20 degrees 30 minutes south, and longitude 29 degrees 22 minutes west,\\nseven hundred miles from the coast of brazil, is but a spot upon the\\nocean. on most maps it is not even a spot. except by birds, turtles, and\\nhideous land-crabs, it is uninhabited; and against the advances of man\\nits shores are fortified with cruel ridges of coral, jagged limestone\\nrocks, and a tremendous towering surf which, even in a dead calm, beats\\nmany feet high against the coast.\\n\\nin 1698 dr. halley visited the island, and says he found nothing living\\nbut doves and land-crabs. “saw many green turtles in sea, but by reason\\nof the great surf, could catch none.”\\n\\nafter halley’s visit, in 1700 the island was settled by a few portuguese\\nfrom brazil. the ruins of their stone huts are still in evidence. but\\namaro delano, who called in 1803, makes no mention of the portuguese;\\nand when, in 1822, commodore owen visited trinidad, he found nothing\\nliving there save cormorants, petrels, gannets, man-of-war birds, and\\n“turtles weighing from five hundred to seven hundred pounds.”\\n\\nin 1889 e. f. knight, who in the japanese-russian war represented the\\nlondon _morning post_, visited trinidad in his yacht in search of buried\\ntreasure.\\n\\nalexander dalrymple, in his book entitled “collection of voages, chiefly\\nin the southern atlantick ocean, 1775,” tells how, in 1700, he “took\\npossession of the island in his majesty’s name as knowing it to be\\ngranted by the king’s letter patent, leaving a union jack flying.”\\n\\nso it appears that before harden-hickey seized the island it already had\\nbeen claimed by great britain, and later, on account of the portuguese\\nsettlement, by brazil. the answer harden-hickey made to these claims\\nwas that the english never settled in trinidad, and that the portuguese\\nabandoned it, and, therefore, their claims lapsed. in his “prospectus”\\n of his island, harden-hickey himself describes it thus:\\n\\n“trinidad is about five miles long and three miles wide. in spite of\\nits rugged and uninviting appearance, the inland plateaus are rich with\\nluxuriant vegetation.\\n\\n“prominent among this is a peculiar species of bean, which is not only\\nedible, but extremely palatable. the surrounding seas swarm with fish,\\nwhich as yet are wholly unsuspicious of the hook. dolphins, rock-cod,\\npigfish, and blackfish may be caught as quickly as they can be hauled\\nout. i look to the sea birds and the turtles to afford our principal\\nsource of revenue. trinidad is the breeding-place of almost the entire\\nfeathery population of the south atlantic ocean. the exportation of\\nguano alone should make my little country prosperous. turtles visit the\\nisland to deposit eggs, and at certain seasons the beach is literally\\nalive with them. the only drawback to my projected kingdom is the fact\\nthat it has no good harbor and can be approached only when the sea is\\ncalm.”\\n\\nas a matter of fact sometimes months pass before it is possible to\\neffect a landing.\\n\\nanother asset of the island held out by the prospectus was its great\\nstore of buried treasure. before harden-hickey seized the island, this\\ntreasure had made it known. this is the legend. in 1821 a great store\\nof gold and silver plate plundered from peruvian churches had been\\nconcealed on the islands by pirates near sugar loaf hill, on the shore\\nof what is known as the southwest bay. much of this plate came from\\nthe cathedral at lima, having been carried from there during the war\\nof independence when the spanish residents fled the country. in their\\neagerness to escape they put to sea in any ship that offered, and these\\nunarmed and unseaworthy vessels fell an easy prey to pirates. one of\\nthese pirates on his death-bed, in gratitude to his former captain, told\\nhim the secret of the treasure. in 1892 this captain was still living,\\nin newcastle, england, and although his story bears a family resemblance\\nto every other story of buried treasure, there were added to the tale of\\nthe pirate some corroborative details. these, in twelve years, induced\\nfive different expeditions to visit the island. the two most important\\nwere that of e. f. knight and one from the tyne in the bark _aurea_.\\n\\nin his “cruise of the _alerte_,” knight gives a full description of the\\nisland, and of his attempt to find the treasure. in this, a landslide\\nhaving covered the place where it was buried, he was unsuccessful.\\n\\nbut knight’s book is the only source of accurate information concerning\\ntrinidad, and in writing his prospectus it is evident that harden-hickey\\nwas forced to borrow from it freely. knight himself says that the most\\nminute and accurate description of trinidad is to be found in the “frank\\nmildmay” of captain marryat. he found it so easy to identify each spot\\nmentioned in the novel that he believes the author of “midshipman easy”\\n himself touched there.\\n\\nafter seizing trinidad, harden-hickey rounded the cape and made north to\\njapan, china, and india. in india he became interested in buddhism, and\\nremained for over a year questioning the priests of that religion and\\nstudying its tenets and history.\\n\\non his return to paris, in 1890, he met miss annie harper flagler,\\ndaughter of john h. flagler. a year later, on st. patrick’s day,\\n1891, at the fifth avenue presbyterian church, miss flagler became the\\nbaroness harden-hickey. the rev. john hall married them.\\n\\nfor the next two years harden-hickey lived in new york, but so quietly\\nthat, except that he lived quietly, it is difficult to find out anything\\nconcerning him. the man who, a few years before, had delighted paris\\nwith his daily feuilletons, with his duels, with his forty-two lawsuits,\\nwho had been the master of revels in the latin quarter, in new york\\nlived almost as a recluse, writing a book on buddhism. while he was in\\nnew york i was a reporter on the _evening sun_, but i cannot recall ever\\nhaving read his name in the newspapers of that day, and i heard of him\\nonly twice; once as giving an exhibition of his water-colors at the\\namerican art galleries, and again as the author of a book i found in a\\nstore in twenty-second street, just east of broadway, then the home of\\nthe truth seeker publishing company.\\n\\nit was a grewsome compilation and had just appeared in print. it was\\ncalled “euthanasia, or the ethics of suicide.” this book was an apology\\nor plea for self-destruction. in it the baron laid down those occasions\\nwhen he considered suicide pardonable, and when obligatory. to support\\nhis arguments and to show that suicide was a noble act, he quoted plato,\\ncicero, shakespeare, and even misquoted the bible. he gave a list of\\npoisons, and the amount of each necessary to kill a human being. to show\\nhow one can depart from life with the least pain, he illustrated the\\ntext with most unpleasant pictures, drawn by himself.\\n\\nthe book showed how far harden-hickey had strayed from the teachings\\nof the jesuit college at namur, and of the church that had made him\\n“noble.”\\n\\nall of these two years had not been spent only in new york.\\nharden-hickey made excursions to california, to mexico, and to texas,\\nand in each of these places bought cattle ranches and mines. the money\\nto pay for these investments came from his father-in-law. but not\\ndirectly. whenever he wanted money he asked his wife, or de la\\nboissiere, who was a friend also of flagler, to obtain it for him.\\n\\nhis attitude toward his father-in-law is difficult to explain. it is not\\napparent that flagler ever did anything which could justly offend him;\\nindeed, he always seems to have spoken of his son-in-law with tolerance,\\nand often with awe, as one would speak of a clever, wayward child. but\\nharden-hickey chose to regard flagler as his enemy, as a sordid man\\nof business who could not understand the feelings and aspirations of a\\ngenius and a gentleman.\\n\\nbefore harden-hickey married, the misunderstanding between his wife’s\\nfather and himself began. because he thought harden-hickey was marrying\\nhis daughter for her money, flagler opposed the union. consequently,\\nharden-hickey married miss flagler without “settlements,” and for the\\nfirst few years supported her without aid from her father. but his\\nwife had been accustomed to a manner of living beyond the means of the\\nsoldier of fortune, and soon his income, and then even his capital, was\\nexhausted. from her mother the baroness inherited a fortune. this was\\nin the hands of her father as executor. when his own money was gone,\\nharden-hickey endeavored to have the money belonging to his wife placed\\nto her credit, or to his. to this, it is said, flagler, on the ground\\nthat harden-hickey was not a man of business, while he was, objected,\\nand urged that he was, and that if it remained in his hands the money\\nwould be better invested and better expended. it was the refusal of\\nflagler to intrust harden-hickey with the care of his wife’s money that\\ncaused the breach between them.\\n\\nas i have said, you cannot judge harden-hickey as you would a\\ncontemporary. with the people among whom he was thrown, his ideas were\\nentirely out of joint. he should have lived in the days of “the three\\nmusketeers.” people who looked upon him as working for his own hand\\nentirely misunderstood him. he was absolutely honest, and as absolutely\\nwithout a sense of humor. to him, to pay taxes, to pay grocers’ bills,\\nto depend for protection upon a policeman, was intolerable. he lived\\nin a world of his own imagining. and one day, in order to make his\\nimaginings real, and to escape from his father-in-law’s unromantic world\\nof standard oil and florida hotels, in a proclamation to the powers\\nhe announced himself as king james the first of the principality of\\ntrinidad.\\n\\nthe proclamation failed to create a world crisis. several of the powers\\nrecognized his principality and his title; but, as a rule, people\\nlaughed, wondered, and forgot. that the daughter of john flagler was\\nto rule the new principality gave it a “news interest,” and for a few\\nsundays in the supplements she was hailed as the “american queen.”\\n\\nwhen upon the subject of the new kingdom flagler himself was\\ninterviewed, he showed an open mind.\\n\\n“my son-in-law is a very determined man,” he said; “he will carry out\\nany scheme in which he is interested. had he consulted me about this,\\ni would have been glad to have aided him with money or advice. my\\nson-in-law is an extremely well-read, refined, well-bred man. he does\\nnot court publicity. while he was staying in my house he spent nearly\\nall the time in the library translating an indian book on buddhism. my\\ndaughter has no ambition to be a queen or anything else than what she\\nis--an american girl. but my son-in-law means to carry on this trinidad\\nscheme, and--he will.”\\n\\nfrom his father-in-law, at least, harden-hickey could not complain that\\nhe had met with lack of sympathy.\\n\\nthe rest of america was amused; and after less than nine days,\\nindifferent. but harden-hickey, though unobtrusively, none the less\\nearnestly continued to play the part of king. his friend de la boissiere\\nhe appointed his minister of foreign affairs, and established in a\\nchancellery at 217 west thirty-sixth street, new york, and from there\\nwas issued a sort of circular, or prospectus, written by the king, and\\nsigned by “le grand chancelier, secretaire d’etat pour les affaires\\netrangeres, m. le comte de la boissiere.”\\n\\nthe document, written in french, announced that the new state would\\nbe governed by a military dictatorship, that the royal standard was a\\nyellow triangle on a red ground, and that the arms of the principality\\nwere “d’or chape de gueules.” it pointed out naively that those who\\nfirst settled on the island would be naturally the oldest inhabitants,\\nand hence would form the aristocracy. but only those who at home enjoyed\\nsocial position and some private fortune would be admitted into this\\nselect circle.\\n\\nfor itself the state reserved a monopoly of the guano, of the turtles,\\nand of the buried treasure. and both to discover the treasure and to\\nencourage settlers to dig and so cultivate the soil, a percentage of the\\ntreasure was promised to the one who found it.\\n\\nany one purchasing ten $200 bonds was entitled to a free passage to the\\nisland, and after a year, should he so desire it, a return trip. the\\nhard work was to be performed by chinese coolies, the aristocracy\\nexisting beautifully, and, according to the prospectus, to enjoy _“vie\\nd’un genre tout nouveau, et la recherche de sensations nouvelles.”_\\n\\nto reward his subjects for prominence in literature, the arts, and the\\nsciences, his majesty established an order of chivalry. the official\\ndocument creating this order reads:\\n\\n\\n“we, james, prince of trinidad, have resolved to commemorate our\\naccession to the throne of trinidad by the institution of an order of\\nchivalry, destined to reward literature, industry, science, and the\\nhuman virtues, and by these presents have established and do institute,\\nwith cross and crown, the order of the insignia of the cross of\\ntrinidad, of which we and our heirs and successors shall be the\\nsovereigns.\\n\\n“given in our chancellery the eighth of the month of december, one\\nthousand eight hundred and ninety-three, and of our reign, the first\\nyear.\\n\\n“james.”\\n\\nthere were four grades: chevalier, commander, grand officer, and grand\\ncross; and the name of each member of the order was inscribed in\\n“the book of gold.” a pension of one thousand francs was given to a\\nchevalier, of two thousand francs to a commander, and of three thousand\\nfrancs to a grand officer. those of the grade of grand cross were\\ncontent with a plaque of eight diamond-studded rays, with, in the\\ncentre, set in red enamel, the arms of trinidad. the ribbon was red and\\nyellow.\\n\\na rule of the order read: “the costume shall be identical with that of\\nthe chamberlains of the court of trinidad, save the buttons, which shall\\nbear the impress of the crown of the order.”\\n\\nfor himself, king james commissioned a firm of jewelers to construct a\\nroyal crown. in design it was similar to the one which surmounted the\\ncross of trinidad. it is shown in the photograph of the insignia. also,\\nthe king issued a set of postage-stamps on which was a picture of\\nthe island. they were of various colors and denominations, and among\\nstamp-collectors enjoyed a certain sale.\\n\\nto-day, as i found when i tried to procure one to use in this book, they\\nare worth many times their face value.\\n\\nfor some time the affairs of the new kingdom progressed favorably. in\\nsan francisco, king james, in person, engaged four hundred coolies and\\nfitted out a schooner which he sent to trinidad, where it made regular\\ntrips between his principality and brazil; an agent was established\\non the island, and the construction of docks, wharves, and houses\\nwas begun, while at the chancellery in west thirty-sixth street, the\\nminister of foreign affairs was ready to furnish would-be settlers with\\ninformation.\\n\\nand then, out of a smiling sky, a sudden and unexpected blow was struck\\nat the independence of the little kingdom. it was a blow from which it\\nnever recovered.\\n\\nin july of 1895, while constructing a cable to brazil, great britain\\nfound the island of trinidad lying in the direct line she wished to\\nfollow, and, as a cable station, seized it. objection to this was made\\nby brazil, and at bahia a mob with stones pelted the sign of the english\\nconsul-general.\\n\\nby right of halley’s discovery, england claimed the island; as a\\nderelict from the main land, brazil also claimed it. between the rivals,\\nthe world saw a chance for war, and the fact that the island really\\nbelonged to our king james for a moment was forgotten.\\n\\nbut the minister of foreign affairs was at his post. with promptitude\\nand vigor he acted. he addressed a circular note to all the powers of\\neurope, and to our state department a protest. it read as follows:\\n\\n\\n  “grande chancellerie de la principaute de\\n  trinidad,\\n  27 west thirty-sixth street,\\n  new york city, u. s. a.,\\n\\n“new york, _july_ 30, 1895.\\n\\n_“to his excellency mr. the secretary of state of the republic of the\\nunited states of north america, washington, d. c.:_\\n\\n“excellency.--i have the honor to recall to your memory:\\n\\n“1. that in the course of the month of september, 1893, baron\\nharden-hickey officially notified all the powers of his taking\\npossession of the uninhabited island of trinidad; and\\n\\n“2. that in course of january, 1894, he renewed to all these powers the\\nofficial notification of the said taking of possession, and informed\\nthem at the same time that from that date the land would be known\\nas ‘principality of trinidad’; that he took the title of ‘prince of\\ntrinidad,’ and would reign under the name of james i.\\n\\n“in consequence of these official notifications several powers have\\nrecognized the new principality and its prince, and at all events none\\nthought it necessary at that epoch to raise objections or formulate\\nopposition.\\n\\n“the press of the entire world has, on the other hand, often acquainted\\nreaders with these facts, thus giving to them all possible publicity. in\\nconsequence of the accomplishment of these various formalities, and\\nas the law of nations prescribes that ‘derelict’ territories belong to\\nwhoever will take possession of them, and as the island of trinidad,\\nwhich has been abandoned for years, certainly belongs to the aforesaid\\ncategory, his serene highness prince james i was authorized to regard\\nhis rights on the said island as perfectly valid and indisputable.\\n\\n“nevertheless, your excellency knows that recently, in spite of all\\nthe legitimate rights of my august sovereign, an english war-ship\\nhas disembarked at trinidad a detachment of armed troops and taken\\npossession of the island in the name of england.\\n\\n“following this assumption of territory, the brazilian government,\\ninvoking a right of ancient portuguese occupation (long ago outlawed),\\nhas notified the english government to surrender the island to brazil.\\n\\n“i beg of your excellency to ask of the government of the united\\nstates of north america to recognize the principality of trinidad as\\nan independent state, and to come to an understanding with the other\\namerican powers in order to guarantee its neutrality.\\n\\n“thus the government of the united states of north america will once\\nmore accord its powerful assistance to the cause of right and of\\njustice, misunderstood by england and brazil, put an end to a situation\\nwhich threatens to disturb the peace, re-establish concord between two\\ngreat states ready to appeal to arms, and affirm itself, moreover, as\\nthe faithful interpreter of the monroe doctrine.\\n\\n“in the expectation of your reply please accept, excellency, the\\nexpression of my elevated consideration.\\n\\n“the grand chancellor, secretary for foreign affairs,\\n\\n“comte de la boissiere.”\\n\\nat that time richard olney was secretary of state, and in his treatment\\nof the protest, and of the gentleman who wrote it, he fully upheld the\\nreputation he made while in office of lack of good manners. saying he\\nwas unable to read the handwriting in which the protest was written,\\nhe disposed of it in a way that would suggest itself naturally to a\\nstatesman and a gentleman. as a “crank” letter he turned it over to the\\nwashington correspondents. you can imagine what they did with it.\\n\\nthe day following the reporters in new york swept down upon the\\nchancellery and upon the minister of foreign affairs. it was the “silly\\nseason” in august, there was no real news in town, and the troubles of\\nde la boissiere were allowed much space.\\n\\nthey laughed at him and at his king, at his chancellery, at his broken\\nenglish, at his “grave and courtly manners,” even at his clothes. but in\\nspite of the ridicule, between the lines you could read that to the man\\nhimself it all was terribly real.\\n\\ni had first heard of the island of trinidad from two men i knew\\nwho spent three months on it searching for the treasure, and when\\nharden-hickey proclaimed himself lord of the island, through the papers\\ni had carefully followed his fortunes. so, partly out of curiosity and\\npartly out of sympathy, i called at the chancellery.\\n\\ni found it in a brownstone house, in a dirty neighborhood just west of\\nseventh avenue, and of where now stands the york hotel. three weeks ago\\ni revisited it and found it unchanged. at the time of my first visit,\\non the jamb of the front door was pasted a piece of paper on which\\nwas written in the handwriting of de la boissiere: “chancellerie de la\\nprincipaute de trinidad.”\\n\\nthe chancellery was not exactly in its proper setting. on its door-step\\nchildren of the tenements were playing dolls with clothes-pins; in the\\nstreet a huckster in raucous tones was offering wilted cabbages to women\\nin wrappers leaning from the fire escapes; the smells and the heat of\\nnew york in midsummer rose from the asphalt. it was a far cry to the\\nwave-swept island off the coast of brazil.\\n\\nde la boissiere received me with distrust. the morning papers had made\\nhim man-shy; but, after a few “your excellencies” and a respectful\\ninquiry regarding “his royal highness,” his confidence revived. in the\\nsituation he saw nothing humorous, not even in an announcement on the\\nwall which read: “sailings to trinidad.” of these there were _two_; on\\nmarch 1, and on october 1. on the table were many copies of the\\nroyal proclamation, the postage-stamps of the new government, the\\nthousand-franc bonds, and, in pasteboard boxes, the gold and red\\nenamelled crosses of the order of trinidad.\\n\\nhe talked to me frankly and fondly of prince james. indeed, i never\\nmet any man who knew harden-hickey well who did not speak of him with\\naggressive loyalty. if at his eccentricities they smiled, it was with\\nthe smile of affection. it was easy to see de la boissiere regarded him\\nnot only with the affection of a friend, but with the devotion of a\\ntrue subject. in his manner he himself was courteous, gentle, and so\\ndistinguished that i felt as though i were enjoying, on intimate terms,\\nan audience with one of the prime-ministers of europe.\\n\\nand he, on his part, after the ridicule of the morning papers, to have\\nany one with outward seriousness accept his high office and his king,\\nwas, i believe, not ungrateful.\\n\\ni told him i wished to visit trinidad, and in that i was quite serious.\\nthe story of an island filled with buried treasure, and governed by a\\nking, whose native subjects were turtles and seagulls, promised to make\\ninteresting writing.\\n\\nthe count was greatly pleased. i believe in me he saw his first\\nbona-fide settler, and when i rose to go he even lifted one of\\nthe crosses of trinidad and, before my envious eyes, regarded it\\nuncertainly.\\n\\nperhaps, had he known that of all decorations it was the one i\\nmost desired; had i only then and there booked my passage, or sworn\\nallegiance to king james, who knows but that to-day i might be a\\nchevalier, with my name in the “book of gold”? but instead of bending\\nthe knee, i reached for my hat; the count replaced the cross in its\\npasteboard box, and for me the psychological moment had passed.\\n\\nothers, more deserving of the honor, were more fortunate. among my\\nfellow-reporters who, like myself, came to scoff, and remained to pray,\\nwas henri pene du bois, for some time, until his recent death, the\\nbrilliant critic of art and music of the _american_. then he was on\\nthe _times_, and henry n. cary, now of the _morning telegraph_, was his\\nmanaging editor.\\n\\nwhen du bois reported to cary on his assignment, he said: “there is\\nnothing funny in that story. it’s pathetic. both those men are in\\nearnest. they are convinced they are being robbed of their rights. their\\nonly fault is that they have imagination, and that the rest of us lack\\nit. that’s the way it struck me, and that’s the way the story ought to\\nbe written.”\\n\\n“write it that way,” said cary.\\n\\nso, of all the new york papers, the _times_, for a brief period, became\\nthe official organ of the government of james the first, and in time\\ncary and du bois were created chevaliers of the order of trinidad, and\\nentitled to wear uniforms “similar to those of the chamberlains of the\\ncourt, save that the buttons bear the impress of the royal crown.”\\n\\nthe attack made by great britain and brazil upon the independence of the\\nprincipality, while it left harden-hickey in the position of a king in\\nexile, brought him at once another crown, which, by those who offered\\nit to him, was described as of incomparably greater value than that of\\ntrinidad.\\n\\nin the first instance the man had sought the throne; in this case the\\nthrone sought the man.\\n\\nin 1893 in san francisco, ralston j. markowe, a lawyer and a one-time\\nofficer of artillery in the united states army, gained renown as one\\nof the morrow filibustering expedition which attempted to overthrow the\\ndole government in the hawaiian isles and restore to the throne queen\\nliliuokalani. in san francisco markowe was nicknamed the “prince of\\nhonolulu,” as it was understood, should liliuokalani regain her\\ncrown, he would be rewarded with some high office. but in the star\\nof liliuokalani, markowe apparently lost faith, and thought he saw\\nin harden-hickey timber more suitable for king-making. accordingly,\\ntwenty-four days after the “protest” was sent to our state department,\\nmarkowe switched his allegiance to harden-hickey, and to him addressed\\nthe following letter:\\n\\n“san francisco, august 26, 1895.\\n\\nbaron harden-hickey, los angeles, cal.:\\n\\n“monseigneur--your favor of august 16 has been received.\\n\\n“1. i am the duly authorized agent of the royalist party in so far as\\nit is possible for any one to occupy that position under existing\\ncircumstances. with the queen in prison and absolutely cut off from\\nall communication with her friends, it is out of the question for me to\\ncarry anything like formal credentials.\\n\\n“2. alienating any part of the territory cannot give rise to any\\nconstitutional questions, for the reason that the constitutions, like\\nthe land tenures, are in a state of such utter confusion that only a\\nstrong hand can unravel them, and the restoration will result in the\\nestablishment of a strong military government. if i go down with the\\nexpedition i have organized i shall be in full control of the situation\\nand in a position to carry out all my contracts.\\n\\n“3. it is the island of kauai on which i propose to establish you as an\\nindependent sovereign.\\n\\n“4. my plan is to successively occupy all the islands, leaving the\\ncapital to the last. when the others have fallen, the capital, being cut\\noff from all its resources, will be easily taken, and may very likely\\nfall without effort. i don’t expect in any case to have to fortify\\nmyself or to take the defensive, or to have to issue a call to arms, as\\ni shall have an overwhelming force to join me at once, in addition to\\nthose who go with me, who by themselves will be sufficient to carry\\neverything before them without active cooperation from the people there.\\n\\n“5. the government forces consist of about 160 men and boys, with very\\nimperfect military training, and of whom about forty are officers. they\\nare organized as infantry. there are also about 600 citizens enrolled\\nas a reserve guard, who may be called upon in case of an emergency,\\nand about 150 police. we can fully rely upon the assistance of all the\\npolice and from one-quarter to one-half of the other troops. and of the\\nremainder many will under no circumstances engage in a sharp fight in\\ndefense of the present government. there are now on the island plenty\\nof men and arms to accomplish our purpose, and if my expedition does\\nnot get off very soon the people there will be organized to do the work\\nwithout other assistance from here than the direction of a few leaders,\\nof which they stand more in need than anything else.\\n\\n“6. the tonnage of the vessel is 146. she at present has berth-room for\\ntwenty men, but bunks can be arranged in the hold for 256 more, with\\nprovision for ample ventilation. she has one complete set of sails and\\ntwo extra spars. the remaining information in regard to her i will have\\nto obtain and send you to-morrow. i think it must be clear to you that\\nthe opportunity now offered you will be of incomparably greater value\\nat once than trinidad would ever be. still hoping that i may have an\\ninterview with you at an early date, respectfully yours,\\n\\n“ralston j. markowe.”\\n\\nwhat harden-hickey thought of this is not known, but as two weeks before\\nhe received it he had written markowe, asking him by what authority he\\nrepresented the royalists of honolulu, it seems evident that when the\\ncrown of hawaii was first proffered him he did not at once spurn it.\\n\\nhe now was in the peculiar position of being a deposed king of an island\\nin the south atlantic, which had been taken from him, and king-elect of\\nan island in the pacific, which was his if he could take it.\\n\\nthis was in august of 1895. for the two years following, harden-hickey\\nwas a soldier of misfortunes. having lost his island kingdom, he could\\nno longer occupy himself with plans for its improvement. it had been\\nhis toy. they had taken it from him, and the loss and the ridicule which\\nfollowed hurt him bitterly.\\n\\nand for the lands he really owned in mexico and california, and which,\\nif he were to live in comfort, it was necessary he should sell, he\\ncould find no purchaser; and, moreover, having quarrelled with his\\nfather-in-law, he had cut off his former supply of money. the need of it\\npinched him cruelly.\\n\\nthe advertised cause of this quarrel was sufficiently characteristic\\nto be the real one. moved by the attack of great britain upon his\\nprincipality, harden-hickey decided upon reprisals. it must be\\nremembered that always he was more irish than french. on paper\\nhe organized an invasion of england from ireland, the home of his\\nancestors. it was because flagler refused to give him money for this\\nadventure that he broke with him. his friends say this was the real\\nreason of the quarrel, which was a quarrel on the side of harden-hickey\\nalone.\\n\\nand there were other, more intimate troubles. while not separated from\\nhis wife, he now was seldom in her company. when the baroness was in\\nparis, harden-hickey was in san francisco; when she returned to san\\nfrancisco, he was in mexico. the fault seems to have been his. he was\\ngreatly admired by pretty women. his daughter by his first wife, now a\\nvery beautiful girl of sixteen, spent much time with her stepmother;\\nand when not on his father’s ranch in mexico, his son also, for months\\ntogether, was at her side. the husband approved of this, but he himself\\nsaw his wife infrequently. nevertheless, early in the spring of 1898,\\nthe baroness leased a house in brockton square, in riverside, cal.,\\nwhere it was understood by herself and by her friends her husband would\\njoin her. at that time in mexico he was trying to dispose of a large\\ntract of land. had he been able to sell it, the money for a time would\\nhave kept one even of his extravagances contentedly rich. at least,\\nhe would have been independent of his wife and of her father. up to\\nfebruary of 1898 his obtaining this money seemed probable.\\n\\nearly in that month the last prospective purchaser decided not to buy.\\n\\nthere is no doubt that had harden-hickey then turned to his\\nfather-in-law, that gentleman, as he had done before, would have opened\\nan account for him.\\n\\nbut the prince of trinidad felt he could no longer beg, even for the\\nmoney belonging to his wife, from the man he had insulted. he could no\\nlonger ask his wife to intercede for him. he was without money of his\\nown, with out the means of obtaining it; from his wife he had ceased to\\nexpect even sympathy, and from the world he knew, the fact that he was\\na self-made king caused him always to be pointed out with ridicule as a\\ncharlatan, as a jest.\\n\\nthe soldier of varying fortunes, the duellist and dreamer, the devout\\ncatholic and devout buddhist, saw the forty-third year of his life only\\nas the meeting-place of many fiascos.\\n\\nhis mind was tormented with imaginary wrongs, imaginary slights,\\nimaginary failures.\\n\\nthis young man, who could paint pictures, write books, organize colonies\\noversea, and with a sword pick the buttons from a waistcoat, forgot the\\ntwenty good years still before him; forgot that men loved him for the\\nmistakes he had made; that in parts of the great city of paris his name\\nwas still spoken fondly, still was famous and familiar.\\n\\nin his book on the “ethics of suicide,” for certain hard places in life\\nhe had laid down an inevitable rule of conduct.\\n\\nas he saw it he had come to one of those hard places, and he would not\\nask of others what he himself would not perform.\\n\\nfrom mexico he set out for california, but not to the house his wife had\\nprepared for him.\\n\\ninstead, on february 9, 1898, at el paso, he left the train and\\nregistered at a hotel.\\n\\nat 7.30 in the evening he went to his room, and when, on the following\\nmorning, they kicked in the door, they found him stretched rigidly upon\\nthe bed, like one lying in state, with, near his hand, a half-emptied\\nbottle of poison.\\n\\non a chair was pinned this letter to his wife:\\n\\n“my dearest,--no news from you, although you have had plenty of time to\\nwrite. harvey has written me that he has no one in view at present to\\nbuy my land. well, i shall have tasted the cup of bitterness to the very\\ndregs, but i do not complain. good-by. i forgive you your conduct toward\\nme and trust you will be able to forgive yourself. i prefer to be a dead\\ngentleman to a living blackguard like your father.”\\n\\n\\nand when they searched his open trunk for something that might identify\\nthe body on the bed, they found the crown of trinidad.\\n\\nyou can imagine it: the mean hotel bedroom, the military figure with\\nits white face and mustache, “_a la_ louis napoleon,” at rest upon the\\npillow, the startled drummers and chambermaids peering in from the hall,\\nand the landlord, or coroner, or doctor, with a bewildered countenance,\\nlifting to view the royal crown of gilt and velvet.\\n\\nthe other actors in this, as harold frederic called it, “opera bouffe\\nmonarchy,” are still living.\\n\\nthe baroness harden-hickey makes her home in this country.\\n\\nthe count de la boissiere, ex-minister of foreign affairs, is still a\\nleader of the french colony in new york, and a prosperous commission\\nmerchant with a suite of offices on fifty-fourth street. by the will of\\nharden-hickey he is executor of his estate, guardian of his children,\\nand what, for the purpose of this article, is of more importance, in\\nhis hands lies the future of the kingdom of trinidad. when harden-hickey\\nkilled himself the title to the island was in dispute. should young\\nharden-hickey wish to claim it, it still would be in dispute. meanwhile,\\nby the will of the first james, de la boissiere is appointed perpetual\\nregent, a sort of “receiver,” and executor of the principality.\\n\\nto him has been left a royal decree signed and sealed, but blank. in the\\nwill the power to fill in this blank with a statement showing the final\\ndisposition of the island has been bestowed upon de la boissiere.\\n\\nso, some day, he may proclaim the accession of a new king, and give a\\nnew lease of life to the kingdom of which harden-hickey dreamed.\\n\\nbut unless his son, or wife, or daughter should assert his or her\\nrights, which is not likely to happen, so ends the dynasty of james the\\nfirst of trinidad, baron of the holy roman empire.\\n\\nto the wise ones in america he was a fool, and they laughed at him; to\\nthe wiser ones, he was a clever rascal who had evolved a new real-estate\\nscheme and was out to rob the people--and they respected him. to my\\nmind, of them all, harden-hickey was the wisest.\\n\\ngranted one could be serious, what could be more delightful than to be\\nyour own king on your own island?\\n\\nthe comic paragraphers, the business men of “hard, common sense,” the\\ncaptains of industry who laughed at him and his national resources\\nof buried treasure, turtles’ eggs, and guano, with his body-guard of\\nzouaves and his grand cross of trinidad, certainly possessed many things\\nthat harden-hickey lacked. but they in turn lacked the things that made\\nhim happy; the power to “make believe,” the love of romance, the touch\\nof adventure that plucked him by the sleeve.\\n\\nwhen, as boys, we used to say: “let’s pretend we’re pirates,” as a man,\\nharden-hickey begged: “let’s pretend i’m a king.”\\n\\nbut the trouble was, the other boys had grown up and would not pretend.\\n\\nfor some reason his end always reminds me of the closing line of\\npinero’s play, when the adventuress, mrs. tanqueray, kills herself, and\\nher virtuous stepchild says: “if we had only been kinder!”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwinston spencer churchill\\n\\nin the strict sense of the phrase, a soldier of fortune is a man who for\\npay, or for the love of adventure, fights under the flag of any country.\\n\\nin the bigger sense he is the kind of man who in any walk of life makes\\nhis own fortune, who, when he sees it coming, leaps to meet it, and\\nturns it to his advantage.\\n\\nthan winston spencer churchill to-day there are few young men--and he is\\na very young man--who have met more varying fortunes, and none who has\\nmore frequently bent them to his own advancement. to him it has been\\nindifferent whether, at the moment, the fortune seemed good or evil, in\\nthe end always it was good.\\n\\nas a boy officer, when other subalterns were playing polo, and at the\\ngaiety theatre attending night school, he ran away to cuba and fought\\nwith the spaniards. for such a breach of military discipline, any other\\nofficer would have been court-martialled. even his friends feared that\\nby his foolishness his career in the army was at an end. instead, his\\nescapade was made a question in the house of commons, and the fact\\nbrought him such publicity that the _daily graphic_ paid him handsomely\\nto write on the cuban revolution, and the spanish government rewarded\\nhim with the order of military merit.\\n\\nat the very outbreak of the boer war he was taken prisoner. it seemed\\na climax of misfortune. with his brother officers he had hoped in that\\ncampaign to acquit himself with credit, and that he should lie inactive\\nin pretoria appeared a terrible calamity. to the others who, through\\nmany heart-breaking months, suffered imprisonment, it continued to be\\na calamity. but within six weeks of his capture churchill escaped, and,\\nafter many adventures, rejoined his own army to find that the calamity\\nhad made him a hero.\\n\\nwhen after the battle of omdurman, in his book on “the river war,” he\\nattacked lord kitchener, those who did not like him, and they were many,\\nsaid: “that’s the end of winston in the army. he’ll never get another\\nchance to criticise k. of k.”\\n\\nbut only two years later the chance came, when, no longer a subaltern,\\nbut as a member of the house of commons, he patronized kitchener by\\ndefending him from the attacks of others.\\n\\nlater, when his assaults upon the leaders of his own party closed to\\nhim, even in his own constituency, the conservative debating clubs,\\nagain his ill-wishers said: “this _is_ the end. he has ridiculed those\\nwho sit in high places. he has offended his cousin and patron, the duke\\nof marlborough. without political friends, without the influence and\\nmoney of the marlborough family he is a political nonentity.” that was\\neighteen months ago. to-day, at the age of thirty-two, he is one of the\\nleaders of the government party, under-secretary for the colonies, and\\nwith the liberals the most popular young man in public life.\\n\\nonly last christmas, at a banquet, sir edward grey, the new foreign\\nsecretary, said of him: “mr. winston churchill has achieved distinction\\nin at least five different careers--as a soldier, a war correspondent,\\na lecturer, an author, and last, but not least, as a politician. i\\nhave understated it even now, for he has achieved two careers as a\\npolitician--one on each side of the house. his first career on the\\ngovernment side was a really distinguished career. i trust the second\\nwill be even more distinguished--and more prolonged. the remarkable\\nthing is that he has done all this when, unless appearances very much\\nbelie him, he has not reached the age of sixty-four, which is the\\nminimum age at which the politician ceases to be young.”\\n\\nwinston leonard spencer churchill was born thirty-two years ago, in\\nnovember, 1874. by birth he is half-american. his father was lord\\nrandolph churchill, and his mother was jennie jerome, of new york.\\non the father’s side he is the grandchild of the seventh duke of\\nmarlborough, on the distaff side, of leonard jerome.\\n\\nto a student of heredity it would be interesting to try and discover\\nfrom which of these ancestors churchill drew those qualities which in\\nhim are most prominent, and which have led to his success.\\n\\nwhat he owes to his father and mother it is difficult to overestimate,\\nalmost as difficult as to overestimate what he has accomplished by his\\nown efforts.\\n\\nhe was not a child born a full-grown genius of commonplace parents.\\nrather his fate threatened that he should always be known as the son\\nof his father. and certainly it was asking much of a boy that he should\\nlive up to a father who was one of the most conspicuous, clever, and\\nerratic statesmen of the later victorian era, and a mother who is as\\nbrilliant as she is beautiful.\\n\\nfor at no time was the american wife content to be merely ornamental.\\nthroughout the political career of her husband she was his helpmate, and\\nas an officer of the primrose league, as an editor of the _anglo-saxon\\nreview_, as, for many hot, weary months in durban harbor, the head\\nof the hospital ship _maine_, she has shown an acute mind and real\\nexecutive power. at the polls many votes that would not respond to the\\narguments of the husband, and later of the son, were gained over to the\\ncause by the charm and wit of the american woman.\\n\\nin his earlier days, if one can have days any earlier than those he now\\nenjoys, churchill was entirely influenced by two things: the tremendous\\nadmiration he felt for his father, which filled him with ambition to\\nfollow in his orbit, and the camaraderie of his mother, who treated him\\nless like a mother than a sister and companion.\\n\\nindeed, churchill was always so precocious that i cannot recall the time\\nwhen he was young enough to be lady randolph’s son; certainly, i cannot\\nrecall the time when she was old enough to be his mother.\\n\\nwhen first i knew him he had passed through harrow and sandhurst and was\\na second lieutenant in the queen’s own hussars. he was just of age, but\\nappeared much younger.\\n\\nhe was below medium height, a slight, delicate-looking boy; although, as\\na matter of fact, extremely strong, with blue eyes, many freckles, and\\nhair which threatened to be a decided red, but which now has lost its\\nfierceness. when he spoke it was with a lisp, which also has changed,\\nand which now appears to be merely an intentional hesitation.\\n\\nhis manner of speaking was nervous, eager, explosive. he used many\\ngestures, some of which were strongly reminiscent of his father, of\\nwhom he, unlike most english lads, who shy at mentioning a distinguished\\nparent, constantly spoke.\\n\\nhe even copied his father in his little tricks of manner. standing with\\nhands shoved under the frock-coat and one resting on each hip as though\\nsqueezing in the waist line; when seated, resting the elbows on the arms\\nof the chair and nervously locking and unclasping fingers, are tricks\\ncommon to both.\\n\\nhe then had and still has a most embarrassing habit of asking many\\nquestions; embarrassing, sometimes, because the questions are so frank,\\nand sometimes because they lay bare the wide expanse of one’s own\\nignorance.\\n\\nat that time, although in his twenty-first year, this lad twice had been\\nmade a question in the house of commons.\\n\\nthat in itself had rendered him conspicuous. when you consider out of\\ngreat britain’s four hundred million subjects how many live, die, and\\nare buried without at any age having drawn down upon themselves the\\nanger of the house of commons, to have done so twice, before one has\\npassed his twenty-first year, seems to promise a lurid future.\\n\\nthe first time churchill disturbed the august assemblage in which so\\nsoon he was to become a leader was when he “ragged” a brother subaltern\\nnamed bruce and cut up his saddle and accoutrements. the second time was\\nwhen he ran away to cuba to fight with the spaniards.\\n\\nafter this campaign, on the first night of his arrival in london, he\\nmade his maiden speech. he delivered it in a place of less dignity\\nthan the house of commons, but one, throughout great britain and her\\ncolonies, as widely known and as well supported. this was the empire\\nmusic hall.\\n\\nat the time mrs. ormiston chant had raised objections to the presence in\\nthe music hall of certain young women, and had threatened, unless they\\nceased to frequent its promenade, to have the license of the music hall\\nrevoked. as a compromise, the management ceased selling liquor, and\\non the night churchill visited the place the bar in the promenade was\\nbarricaded with scantling and linen sheets. with the thirst of tropical\\ncuba still upon him, churchill asked for a drink, which was denied him,\\nand the crusade, which in his absence had been progressing fiercely,\\nwas explained. any one else would have taken no for his answer, and\\nhave sought elsewhere for his drink. not so churchill. what he did is\\ninteresting, because it was so extremely characteristic. now he would\\nnot do it; then he was twenty-one.\\n\\nhe scrambled to the velvet-covered top of the railing which divides\\nthe auditorium from the promenade, and made a speech. it was a plea in\\nbehalf of his “sisters, the ladies of the empire promenade.”\\n\\n“where,” he asked of the ladies themselves and of their escorts crowded\\nbelow him in the promenade, “does the englishman in london always find a\\nwelcome? where does he first go when, battle-scarred and travel-worn,\\nhe reaches home? who is always there to greet him with a smile, and\\njoin him in a drink? who is ever faithful, ever true--the ladies of the\\nempire promenade.”\\n\\nthe laughter and cheers that greeted this, and the tears of the ladies\\nthemselves, naturally brought the performance on the stage to a stop,\\nand the vast audience turned in the seats and boxes.\\n\\nthey saw a little red-haired boy in evening clothes, balancing himself\\non the rail of the balcony, and around him a great crowd, cheering,\\nshouting, and bidding him “go on!”\\n\\nchurchill turned with delight to the larger audience, and repeated his\\nappeal. the house shook with laughter and applause.\\n\\nthe commissionaires and police tried to reach him and a good-tempered\\nbut very determined mob of well-dressed gentlemen and cheering girls\\nfought them back. in triumph churchill ended his speech by begging his\\nhearers to give “fair play” to the women, and to follow him in a charge\\nupon the barricades.\\n\\nthe charge was instantly made, the barricades were torn down, and the\\nterrified management ordered that drink be served to its victorious\\npatrons.\\n\\nshortly after striking this blow for the liberty of others, churchill\\norganized a dinner which illustrated the direction in which at that age\\nhis mind was working, and showed that his ambition was already abnormal.\\nthe dinner was given to those of his friends and acquaintances who “were\\nunder twenty-one years of age, and who in twenty years would control the\\ndestinies of the british empire.”\\n\\nas one over the age limit, or because he did not consider me an\\nempire-controlling force, on this great occasion, i was permitted to\\nbe present. but except that the number of incipient empire-builders was\\nvery great, that they were very happy, and that save the host himself\\nnone of them took his idea seriously, i would not call it an evening of\\nhistorical interest. but the fact is interesting that of all the\\nboys present, as yet, the host seems to be the only one who to any\\nconspicuous extent is disturbing the destinies of great britain.\\nhowever, the others can reply that ten of the twenty years have not yet\\npassed.\\n\\nwhen he was twenty-three churchill obtained leave of absence from his\\nregiment, and as there was no other way open to him to see fighting, as\\na correspondent he joined the malakand field force in india.\\n\\nit may be truthfully said that by his presence in that frontier war he\\nmade it and himself famous. his book on that campaign is his best piece\\nof war reporting. to the civilian reader it has all the delight of one\\nof kipling’s indian stories, and to writers on military subjects it is\\na model. but it is a model very few can follow, and which churchill\\nhimself was unable to follow, for the reason that only once is it given\\na man to be twenty-three years of age.\\n\\nthe picturesque hand-to-hand fighting, the night attacks, the charges up\\nprecipitous hills, the retreats made carrying the wounded under constant\\nfire, which he witnessed and in which he bore his part, he never\\nagain can see with the same fresh and enthusiastic eyes. then it was\\nabsolutely new, and the charm of the book and the value of the book are\\nthat with the intolerance of youth he attacks in the service evils that\\nolder men prefer to let lie, and that with the ingenuousness of youth he\\ntells of things which to the veteran have become unimportant, or which\\nthrough usage he is no longer even able to see.\\n\\nin his three later war books, the wonder of it, the horror of it, the\\nquick admiration for brave deeds and daring men, give place, in “the\\nriver war,” to the critical point of view of the military expert, and\\nin his two books on the boer war to the rapid impressions of the\\njournalist. in these latter books he tells you of battles he has seen,\\nin the first one he made you see them.\\n\\nfor his services with the malakand field force he received the campaign\\nmedal with clasp, and, “in despatches,” brigadier-general jeffreys\\npraises “the courage and resolution of lieutenant w. l. s. churchill,\\nfourth hussars, with the force as correspondent of the _pioneer_.”\\n\\nfrom the operations around malakand, he at once joined sir william\\nlockhart as orderly officer, and with the tirah expedition went through\\nthat campaign.\\n\\nfor this his indian medal gained a second clasp.\\n\\nthis was in the early part of 1898. in spite of the time taken up as\\nan officer and as a correspondent, he finished his book on the malakand\\nexpedition and then, as it was evident kitchener would soon attack\\nkhartum, he jumped across to egypt and again as a correspondent took\\npart in the advance upon that city.\\n\\nthus, in one year, he had seen service in three campaigns.\\n\\non the day of the battle his luck followed him. kitchener had attached\\nhim to the twenty-first lancers, and it will be remembered the event of\\nthe battle was the charge made by that squadron. it was no canter, no\\neasy “pig-sticking”; it was a fight to get in and a fight to get out,\\nwith frenzied followers of the khalifa hanging to the bridle reins,\\nhacking at the horses’ hamstrings, and slashing and firing point-blank\\nat the troopers. churchill was in that charge. he received the medal\\nwith clasp.\\n\\nthen he returned home and wrote “the river war.” this book is the last\\nword on the campaigns up the nile. from the death of gordon in khartum\\nto the capture of the city by kitchener, it tells the story of the many\\ngallant fights, the wearying failures, the many expeditions into the\\nhot, boundless desert, the long, slow progress toward the final winning\\nof the sudan.\\n\\nthe book made a distinct sensation. it was a work that one would expect\\nfrom a lieutenant-general, when, after years of service in egypt, he\\nlaid down his sword to pen the story of his life’s work. from a second\\nlieutenant, who had been on the nile hardly long enough to gain the\\ndesert tan, it was a revelation. as a contribution to military history\\nit was so valuable that for the author it made many admirers, but on\\naccount of his criticisms of his superior officers it gained him even\\nmore enemies.\\n\\nthis is a specimen of the kind of thing that caused the retired army\\nofficer to sit up and choke with apoplexy:\\n\\n“general kitchener, who never spares himself, cares little for others.\\nhe treated all men like machines, from the private soldiers, whose\\nsalutes he disdained, to the superior officers, whom he rigidly\\ncontrolled. the comrade who had served with him and under him for many\\nyears, in peace and peril, was flung aside as soon as he ceased to be of\\nuse. the wounded egyptian and even the wounded british soldier did not\\nexcite his interest.”\\n\\nwhen in the service clubs they read that, the veterans asked each other\\ntheir favorite question of what is the army coming to, and to their\\nown satisfaction answered it by pointing out that when a lieutenant of\\ntwenty-four can reprimand the commanding general the army is going to\\nthe dogs.\\n\\nto the newspapers, hundreds of them, over their own signatures, on\\nthe service club stationery, wrote violent, furious letters, and the\\nnewspapers themselves, besides the ordinary reviews, gave to the book\\neditorial praise and editorial condemnation.\\n\\nequally disgusted were the younger officers of the service. they\\nnicknamed his book “a subaltern’s advice to generals,” and called\\nchurchill himself a “medal snatcher.” a medal snatcher is an officer\\nwho, whenever there is a rumor of war, leaves his men to the care of\\nany one, and through influence in high places and for the sake of the\\ncampaign medal has himself attached to the expeditionary force. but\\nchurchill never was a medal hunter. the routine of barrack life irked\\nhim, and in foreign parts he served his country far better than by\\nremaining at home and inspecting awkward squads and attending guard\\nmount. indeed, the war office could cover with medals the man who wrote\\n“the story of the malakand field force” and “the river war” and still be\\nin his debt.\\n\\nin october, 1898, a month after the battle of omdurman, churchill\\nmade his debut as a political speaker at minor meetings in dover and\\nrotherhithe. history does not record that these first speeches set fire\\nto the channel. during the winter he finished and published his “river\\nwar,” and in the august of the following summer, 1899, at a by-election,\\noffered himself as member of parliament for oldham.\\n\\nin the _daily telegraph_ his letters from the three campaigns in india\\nand egypt had made his name known, and there was a general desire to\\nhear him and to see him. in one who had attacked kitchener of khartum,\\nthe men of oldham expected to find a stalwart veteran, bearded, and with\\na voice of command. when they were introduced to a small red-haired boy\\nwith a lisp, they refused to take him seriously. in england youth is an\\nunpardonable thing. lately, curzon, churchill, edward grey, hugh cecil,\\nand others have made it less reprehensible. but, in spite of a vigorous\\ncampaign, in which lady randolph took an active part, oldham decided\\nit was not ready to accept young churchill for a member. later he was\\noldham’s only claim to fame.\\n\\na week after he was defeated he sailed for south africa, where war with\\nthe boers was imminent. he had resigned from his regiment and went south\\nas war correspondent for the _morning post_.\\n\\nlater in the war he held a commission as lieutenant in the south african\\nlight horse, a regiment of irregular cavalry, and on the staffs\\nof different generals acted as galloper and aide-de-camp. to this\\ncombination of duties, which was in direct violation of a rule of the\\nwar office, his brother officers and his fellow correspondents objected;\\nbut, as in each of his other campaigns he had played this dual role, the\\npress censors considered it a traditional privilege, and winked at it.\\nas a matter of record, churchill’s soldiering never seemed to interfere\\nwith his writing, nor, in a fight, did his duty to his paper ever\\nprevent him from mixing in as a belligerent.\\n\\nwar was declared october 9th, and only a month later, while scouting in\\nthe armored train along the railroad line between pietermaritzburg and\\ncolenso, the cars were derailed and churchill was taken prisoner.\\n\\nthe train was made up of three flat cars, two armored cars, and between\\nthem the engine, with three cars coupled to the cow-catcher and two to\\nthe tender.\\n\\non the outward trip the boers did not show themselves, but as soon as\\nthe english passed frere station they rolled a rock on the track at a\\npoint where it was hidden by a curve. on the return trip, as the english\\napproached this curve the boers opened fire with artillery and pompoms.\\nthe engineer, in his eagerness to escape, rounded the curve at full\\nspeed, and, as the boers had expected, hit the rock. the three forward\\ncars were derailed, and one of them was thrown across the track, thus\\npreventing the escape of the engine and the two rear cars. from these\\ncaptain haldane, who was in command, with a detachment of the dublins,\\nkept up a steady fire on the enemy, while churchill worked to clear the\\ntrack. to assist him he had a company of natal volunteers, and those who\\nhad not run away of the train hands and break-down crew.\\n\\n“we were not long left in the comparative safety of a railroad\\naccident,” churchill writes to his paper. “the boers’ guns, swiftly\\nchanging their position, reopened fire from a distance of thirteen\\nhundred yards before any one had got out of the stage of exclamations.\\nthe tapping rifle-fire spread along the hills, until it encircled the\\nwreckage on three sides, and from some high ground on the opposite side\\nof the line a third field-gun came into action.”\\n\\nfor boer marksmen with mausers and pompoms, a wrecked railroad train\\nat thirteen hundred yards was as easy a bull’s-eye as the hands of the\\nfirst baseman to the pitcher, and while the engine butted and snorted\\nand the men with their bare bands tore at the massive beams of the\\nfreight-car, the bullets and shells beat about them.\\n\\n“i have had in the last four years many strange and varied experiences,”\\n continues young churchill, “but nothing was so thrilling as this; to\\nwait and struggle among these clanging, rending iron boxes, with the\\nrepeated explosions of the shells, the noise of the projectiles striking\\nthe cars, the hiss as they passed in the air, the grunting and puffing\\nof the engine--poor, tortured thing, hammered by at least a dozen\\nshells, any one of which, by penetrating the boiler, might have made an\\nend of all--the expectation of destruction as a matter of course, the\\nrealization of powerlessness--all this for seventy minutes by the clock,\\nwith only four inches of twisted iron between danger, captivity, and\\nshame on one side--and freedom on the other.”\\n\\nthe “protected” train had proved a deathtrap, and by the time the line\\nwas clear every fourth man was killed or wounded. only the engine,\\nwith the more severely wounded heaped in the cab and clinging to its\\ncow-catcher and foot-rails, made good its escape. among those left\\nbehind, a tommy, without authority, raised a handkerchief on his rifle,\\nand the boers instantly ceased firing and came galloping forward to\\naccept surrender. there was a general stampede to escape. seeing that\\nlieutenant franklin was gallantly trying to hold his men, churchill,\\nwho was safe on the engine, jumped from it and ran to his assistance. of\\nwhat followed, this is his own account:\\n\\n“scarcely had the locomotive left me than i found myself alone in a\\nshallow cutting, and none of our soldiers, who had all surrendered,\\nto be seen. then suddenly there appeared on the line at the end of the\\ncutting two men not in uniform. ‘plate-layers,’ i said to myself, and\\nthen, with a surge of realization, ‘boers.’ my mind retains a momentary\\nimpression of these tall figures, full of animated movement, clad in\\ndark flapping clothes, with slouch, storm-driven hats, posing their\\nrifles hardly a hundred yards away. i turned and ran between the\\nrails of the track, and the only thought i achieved was this: ‘boer\\nmarksmanship.’\\n\\n“two bullets passed, both within a foot, one on either side. i flung\\nmyself against the banks of the cutting. but they gave no cover. another\\nglance at the figures; one was now kneeling to aim. again i darted\\nforward. again two soft kisses sucked in the air, but nothing struck me.\\ni must get out of the cutting--that damnable corridor. i scrambled up\\nthe bank. the earth sprang up beside me, and a bullet touched my hand,\\nbut outside the cutting was a tiny depression. i crouched in this,\\nstruggling to get my wind. on the other side of the railway a horseman\\ngalloped up, shouting to me and waving his hand. he was scarcely forty\\nyards off. with a rifle i could have killed him easily. i knew nothing\\nof the white flag, and the bullets had made me savage. i reached down\\nfor my mauser pistol. i had left it in the cab of the engine. between me\\nand the horseman there was a wire fence. should i continue to fly?\\nthe idea of another shot at such a short range decided me. death stood\\nbefore me, grim and sullen; death without his light-hearted companion,\\nchance. so i held up my hand, and like mr. jorrock’s foxes, cried\\n‘capivy!’ then i was herded with the other prisoners in a miserable\\ngroup, and about the same time i noticed that my hand was bleeding, and\\nit began to pour with rain.\\n\\n“two days before i had written to an officer at home: ‘there has been a\\ngreat deal too much surrendering in this war, and i hope people who do\\nso will not be encouraged.’”\\n\\nwith other officers, churchill was imprisoned in the state model\\nschools, situated in the heart of pretoria. it was distinctly\\ncharacteristic that on the very day of his arrival he began to plan to\\nescape.\\n\\ntoward this end his first step was to lose his campaign hat, which he\\nrecognized was too obviously the hat of an english officer. the burgher\\nto whom he gave money to purchase him another innocently brought him a\\nboer sombrero.\\n\\nbefore his chance to escape came a month elapsed, and the opportunity\\nthat then offered was less an opportunity to escape than to get himself\\nshot.\\n\\nthe state model schools were surrounded by the children’s playgrounds,\\npenned in by a high wall, and at night, while they were used as a\\nprison, brilliantly lighted by electric lights. after many nights of\\nobservation, churchill discovered that while the sentries were pacing\\ntheir beats there was a moment when to them a certain portion of the\\nwall was in darkness. this was due to cross-shadows cast by the electric\\nlights. on the other side of this wall there was a private house set in\\na garden filled with bushes. beyond this was the open street.\\n\\nto scale the wall was not difficult; the real danger lay in the fact\\nthat at no time were the sentries farther away than fifteen yards, and\\nthe chance of being shot by one or both of them was excellent. to a\\nbrother officer churchill confided his purpose, and together they agreed\\nthat some night when the sentries had turned from the dark spot on the\\nwall they would scale it and drop among the bushes in the garden. after\\nthey reached the garden, should they reach it alive, what they were to\\ndo they did not know. how they were to proceed through the streets\\nand out of the city, how they were to pass unchallenged under its many\\nelectric lights and before the illuminated shop windows, how to dodge\\npatrols, and how to find their way through two hundred and eighty\\nmiles of a south african wilderness, through an utterly unfamiliar,\\nunfriendly, and sparsely settled country into portuguese territory and\\nthe coast, they left to chance. but with luck they hoped to cover the\\ndistance in a fortnight, begging corn at the kaffir kraals, sleeping by\\nday, and marching under cover of the darkness.\\n\\nthey agreed to make the attempt on the 11th of december, but on that\\nnight the sentries did not move from the only part of the wall that was\\nin shadow. on the night following, at the last moment, something delayed\\nchurchill’s companion, and he essayed the adventure alone. he writes:\\n\\n“tuesday, the 12th! anything was better than further suspense. again\\nnight came. again the dinner bell sounded. choosing my opportunity,\\ni strolled across the quadrangle and secreted myself in one of the\\noffices. through a chink i watched the sentries. for half an hour they\\nremained stolid and obstructive. then suddenly one turned and walked up\\nto his comrade and they began to talk. their backs were turned.\\n\\n“i darted out of my hiding-place and ran to the wall, seized the top with\\nmy hands and drew myself up. twice i let myself down again in sickly\\nhesitation, and then with a third resolve scrambled up. the top was\\nflat. lying on it, i had one parting glimpse of the sentries, still\\ntalking, still with their backs turned, but, i repeat, still fifteen\\nyards away. then i lowered myself into the adjoining garden and crouched\\namong the shrubs. i was free. the first step had been taken, and it was\\nirrevocable.”\\n\\nchurchill discovered that the house into the garden of which he had so\\nunceremoniously introduced himself was brilliantly lighted, and that the\\nowner was giving a party. at one time two of the guests walked into the\\ngarden and stood, smoking and chatting, in the path within a few yards\\nof him.\\n\\nthinking his companion might yet join him, for an hour he crouched in\\nthe bushes, until from the other side of the wall he heard the voices of\\nhis friend and of another officer.\\n\\n“it’s all up!” his friend whispered. churchill coughed tentatively.\\nthe two voices drew nearer. to confuse the sentries, should they be\\nlistening, the one officer talked nonsense, laughed loudly, and quoted\\nlatin phrases, while the other, in a low and distinct voice, said:\\n“i cannot get out. the sentry suspects. it’s all up. can you get back\\nagain?”\\n\\nto go back was impossible. churchill now felt that in any case he was\\nsure to be recaptured, and decided he would, as he expresses it, at\\nleast have a run for his money.\\n\\n“i shall go on alone,” he whispered.\\n\\nhe heard the footsteps of his two friends move away from him across the\\nplay yard. at the same moment he stepped boldly out into the garden and,\\npassing the open windows of the house, walked down the gravel path to\\nthe street. not five yards from the gate stood a sentry. most of those\\nguarding the school-house knew him by sight, but churchill did not turn\\nhis head, and whether the sentry recognized him or not, he could not\\ntell.\\n\\nfor a hundred feet he walked as though on ice, inwardly shrinking as he\\nwaited for the sharp challenge, and the rattle of the mauser thrown to\\nthe “ready.” his nerves were leaping, his heart in his throat, his spine\\nof water. and then, as he continued to advance, and still no tumult\\npursued him, he quickened his pace and turned into one of the main\\nstreets of pretoria. the sidewalks were crowded with burghers, but no\\none noticed him. this was due probably to the fact that the boers wore\\nno distinctive uniform, and that with them in their commandoes were many\\nenglish colonials who wore khaki riding breeches, and many americans,\\nfrench, germans, and russians, in every fashion of semi-uniform.\\n\\nif observed, churchill was mistaken for one of these, and the very\\nopenness of his movements saved him from suspicion.\\n\\nstraight through the town he walked until he reached the suburbs, the\\nopen veldt, and a railroad track. as he had no map or compass he knew\\nthis must be his only guide, but he knew also that two railroads left\\npretoria, the one along which he had been captured, to pietermaritzburg,\\nand the other, the one leading to the coast and freedom. which of the\\ntwo this one was he had no idea, but he took his chance, and a hundred\\nyards beyond a station waited for the first outgoing train. about\\nmidnight, a freight stopped at the station, and after it had left it and\\nbefore it had again gathered headway, churchill swung himself up upon\\nit, and stretched out upon a pile of coal. throughout the night the\\ntrain continued steadily toward the east, and so told him that it was\\nthe one he wanted, and that he was on his way to the neutral territory\\nof portugal.\\n\\nfearing the daylight, just before the sun rose, as the train was pulling\\nup a steep grade, he leaped off into some bushes. all that day he lay\\nhidden, and the next night he walked. he made but little headway. as all\\nstations and bridges were guarded, he had to make long detours, and the\\ntropical moonlight prevented him from crossing in the open. in this way,\\nsleeping by day, walking by night, begging food from the kaffirs, five\\ndays passed.\\n\\nmeanwhile, his absence had been at once discovered, and, by the\\nboers, every effort was being made to retake him. telegrams giving his\\ndescription were sent along both railways, three thousand photographs\\nof him were distributed, each car of every train was searched, and\\nin different parts of the transvaal men who resembled him were being\\narrested. it was said he had escaped dressed as a woman; in the uniform\\nof a transvaal policeman whom he had bribed; that he had never left\\npretoria, and that in the disguise of a waiter he was concealed in the\\nhouse of a british sympathizer. on the strength of this rumor the houses\\nof all suspected persons were searched.\\n\\nin the volksstem it was pointed out as a significant fact that a week\\nbefore his escape churchill had drawn from the library mill’s “essay on\\nliberty.”\\n\\nin england and over all british south africa the escape created as much\\ninterest as it did in pretoria. because the attempt showed pluck, and\\nbecause he had outwitted the enemy, churchill for the time became a sort\\nof popular hero, and to his countrymen his escape gave as much pleasure\\nas it was a cause of chagrin to the boers.\\n\\nbut as days passed and nothing was heard of him, it was feared he\\nhad lost himself in the machadodorp mountains, or had succumbed\\nto starvation, or, in the jungle toward the coast, to fever, and\\ncongratulations gave way to anxiety.\\n\\nthe anxiety was justified, for at this time churchill was in a very bad\\nway. during the month in prison he had obtained but little exercise. the\\nlack of food and of water, the cold by night and the terrific heat by\\nday, the long stumbling marches in the darkness, the mental effect upon\\nan extremely nervous, high-strung organization of being hunted, and of\\nhaving to hide from his fellow men, had worn him down to a condition\\nalmost of collapse.\\n\\neven though it were neutral soil, in so exhausted a state he dared not\\nventure into the swamps and waste places of the portuguese territory;\\nand, sick at heart as well as sick in body, he saw no choice left him\\nsave to give himself up.\\n\\nbut before doing so he carefully prepared a tale which, although most\\nimprobable, he hoped might still conceal his identity and aid him to\\nescape by train across the border.\\n\\none night after days of wandering he found himself on the outskirts of\\na little village near the boundary line of the transvaal and portuguese\\nterritory. utterly unable to proceed further, he crawled to the nearest\\nzinc-roofed shack, and, fully prepared to surrender, knocked at the\\ndoor. it was opened by a rough-looking, bearded giant, the first white\\nman to whom in many days churchill had dared address himself.\\n\\nto him, without hope, he feebly stammered forth the speech he had\\nrehearsed. the man listened with every outward mark of disbelief. at\\nchurchill himself he stared with open suspicion. suddenly he seized the\\nboy by the shoulder, drew him inside the hut, and barred the door.\\n\\n“you needn’t lie to me,” he said. “you are winston churchill, and i--am\\nthe only englishman in this village.”\\n\\nthe rest of the adventure was comparatively easy. the next night his\\nfriend in need, an engineer named howard, smuggled churchill into a\\nfreight-car, and hid him under sacks of some soft merchandise.\\n\\nat komatie-poort, the station on the border, for eighteen hours the car\\nin which churchill lay concealed was left in the sun on a siding, and\\nbefore it again started it was searched, but the man who was conducting\\nthe search lifted only the top layer of sacks, and a few minutes later\\nchurchill heard the hollow roar of the car as it passed over the bridge,\\nand knew that he was across the border.\\n\\neven then he took no chances, and for two days more lay hidden at the\\nbottom of the car.\\n\\nwhen at last he arrived in lorenzo marques he at once sought out the\\nenglish consul, who, after first mistaking him for a stoker from one of\\nthe ships in the harbor, gave him a drink, a bath, and a dinner.\\n\\nas good luck would have it, the _induna_ was leaving that night for\\ndurban, and, escorted by a body-guard of english residents armed with\\nrevolvers, and who were taking no chances of his recapture by the boer\\nagents, he was placed safely on board. two days later he arrived at\\ndurban, where he was received by the mayor, the populace, and a brass\\nband playing: “britons never, never, never shall be slaves!”\\n\\nfor the next month churchill was bombarded by letters and telegrams\\nfrom every part of the globe, some invited him to command filibustering\\nexpeditions, others sent him woollen comforters, some forwarded\\nphotographs of himself to be signed, others photographs of themselves,\\npossibly to be admired, others sent poems, and some bottles of whiskey.\\n\\none admirer wrote: “my congratulations on your wonderful and glorious\\ndeeds, which will send such a thrill of pride and enthusiasm through\\ngreat britain and the united states of america, that the anglo-saxon\\nrace will be irresistible.”\\n\\nlest so large an order as making the anglo-saxon race irresistible might\\nturn the head of a subaltern, an antiseptic cablegram was also sent him,\\nfrom london, reading:\\n\\n“best friends here hope you won’t go making further ass of yourself.\\n\\n“mcneill.”\\n\\none day in camp we counted up the price per word of this cablegram, and\\nchurchill was delighted to find that it must have cost the man who sent\\nit five pounds.\\n\\non the day of his arrival in durban, with the cheers still in the air,\\nchurchill took the first train to “the front,” then at colenso. another\\nman might have lingered. after a month’s imprisonment and the hardships\\nof the escape, he might have been excused for delaying twenty-four hours\\nto taste the sweets of popularity and the flesh-pots of the queen hotel.\\nbut if the reader has followed this brief biography he will know that\\nto have done so would have been out of the part. this characteristic of\\nchurchill’s to get on to the next thing explains his success. he has no\\ntime to waste on postmortems, he takes none to rest on his laurels.\\n\\nas a war correspondent and officer he continued with buller until the\\nrelief of ladysmith, and with roberts until the fall of pretoria. he\\nwas in many actions, in all the big engagements, and came out of the war\\nwith another medal and clasps for six battles.\\n\\non his return to london he spent the summer finishing his second book on\\nthe war, and in october at the general election as a “khaki” candidate,\\nas those were called who favored the war, again stood for oldham. this\\ntime, with his war record to help him, he wrested from the liberals one\\nof oldham’s two seats. he had been defeated by thirteen hundred votes;\\nhe was elected by a majority of two hundred and twenty-seven.\\n\\nthe few months that intervened between his election and the opening of\\nthe new parliament were snatched by churchill for a lecturing tour at\\nhome, and in the united states and canada. his subject was the war and\\nhis escape from pretoria.\\n\\nwhen he came to this country half of the people here were in sympathy\\nwith the boers, and did not care to listen to what they supposed would\\nbe a strictly british version of the war. his manager, without asking\\npermission of those whose names he advertised, organized for churchill’s\\nfirst appearance in various cities, different reception committees.\\n\\nsome of those whose names, without their consent, were used for these\\ncommittees, wrote indignantly to the papers, saying that while for\\nchurchill, personally, they held every respect, they objected to being\\nused to advertise an anti-boer demonstration.\\n\\nwhile this was no fault of churchill’s, who, until he reached this\\ncountry knew nothing of it, it was neither for him nor for the success\\nof his tour the best kind of advance work.\\n\\nduring the fighting to relieve ladysmith, with general buller’s force,\\nchurchill and i had again been together, and later when i joined the\\nboer army, at the zand river battle, the army with which he was a\\ncorrespondent had chased the army with which i was a correspondent,\\nforty miles. i had been one of those who refused to act on his reception\\ncommittee, and he had come to this country with a commission from twenty\\nbrother officers to shoot me on sight. but in his lecture he was using\\nthe photographs i had taken of the scene of his escape, and which i had\\nsent him from pretoria as a souvenir, and when he arrived i was at the\\nhotel to welcome him, and that same evening three hours after midnight\\nhe came, in a blizzard, pounding at our door for food and drink. what is\\na little thing like a war between friends?\\n\\nduring his “tour,” except of hotels, parlor-cars, and “lyceums,” he saw\\nvery little of this country or of its people, and they saw very little\\nof him. on the trip, which lasted about two months, he cleared ten\\nthousand dollars. this, to a young man almost entirely dependent for an\\nincome upon his newspaper work and the sale of his books, nearly repaid\\nhim for the two months of “one night stands.” on his return to london he\\ntook his seat in the new parliament.\\n\\nit was a coincidence that he entered parliament at the same age as\\ndid his father. with two other members, one born six days earlier than\\nhimself, he enjoyed the distinction of being among the three youngest\\nmembers of the new house.\\n\\nthe fact did not seem to appall him. in the house it is a tradition that\\nyoung and ambitious members sit “below” the gangway; the more modest\\nand less assured are content to place themselves “above” it, at a point\\nfarthest removed from the leaders.\\n\\non the day he was sworn in there was much curiosity to see where\\nchurchill would elect to sit. in his own mind there was apparently no\\ndoubt. after he had taken the oath, signed his name, and shaken the hand\\nof the speaker, without hesitation he seated himself on the bench next\\nto the ministry. ten minutes later, so a newspaper of the day describes\\nit, he had cocked his hat over his eyes, shoved his hands into his\\ntrousers pockets, and was lolling back eying the veterans of the house\\nwith critical disapproval.\\n\\nhis maiden speech was delivered in may, 1901, in reply to david lloyd\\ngeorge, who had attacked the conduct of british soldiers in south\\nafrica. churchill defended them, and in a manner that from all sides\\ngained him honest admiration. in the course of the debate he produced\\nand read a strangely apropos letter which, fifteen years before, had\\nbeen written by his father to lord salisbury. his adroit use of\\nthis filled h. w. massingham, the editor of the _daily news_, with\\nenthusiasm. nothing in parliamentary tactics, he declared, since mr.\\ngladstone died, had been so clever. he proclaimed that churchill would\\nbe premier. john dillon, the nationalist leader, said he never before\\nhad seen a young man, by means of his maiden effort, spring into the\\nfront rank of parliamentary speakers. he promised that the irish members\\nwould ungrudgingly testify to his ability and honesty of purpose. among\\nothers to at once recognize the rising star was t. p. o’connor, himself\\nfor many years of the parliamentary firmament one of the brightest\\nstars. in _m. a. p._ he wrote: “i am inclined to think that the dash of\\namerican blood which he has from his mother has been an improvement on\\nthe original stock, and that mr. winston churchill may turn out to be a\\nstronger and abler politician than his father.”\\n\\nit was all a part of churchill’s “luck” that when he entered parliament\\nthe subject in debate was the conduct of the war.\\n\\neven in those first days of his career in the house, in debates where\\nangels feared to tread, he did not hesitate to rush in, but this subject\\nwas one on which he spoke with knowledge. over the older men who were\\nforced to quote from hearsay or from what they had read, churchill had\\nthe tremendous advantage of being able to protest: “you only read of\\nthat. i was there. i saw it.”\\n\\nin the house he became at once one of the conspicuous and picturesque\\nfigures, one dear to the heart of the caricaturist, and one from the\\nstrangers’ gallery most frequently pointed out. he was called “the\\nspoiled child of the house,” and there were several distinguished\\ngentlemen who regretted they were forced to spare the rod. broderick,\\nthe secretary for war, was one of these. of him and of his recruits in\\nsouth africa, churchill spoke with the awful frankness of the _enfant\\nterrible_. and although he addressed them more with sorrow than with\\nanger, to balfour and chamberlain he daily administered advice and\\nreproof, while mere generals and field-marshals, like kitchener and\\nroberts, blushing under new titles, were held up for public reproof and\\nbriefly but severely chastened. nor, when he saw lord salisbury going\\nastray, did he hesitate in his duty to the country, but took the prime\\nminister by the hand and gently instructed him in the way he should go.\\n\\nthis did not tend to make him popular, but in spite of his unpopularity,\\nin his speeches against national extravagancies he made so good a fight\\nthat he forced the government, unwillingly, to appoint a committee to\\ninvestigate the need of economy. for a beginner this was a distinct\\ntriumph.\\n\\nwith lord hugh cecil, lord percy, ian malcolm, and other clever young\\nmen, he formed inside the conservative party a little group that in its\\nobstructive and independent methods was not unlike the fourth party of\\nhis father. from its leader and its filibustering, guerilla-like tactics\\nthe men who composed it were nicknamed the “hughligans.” the hughligans\\nwere the most active critics of the ministry and of all in their own\\nparty, and as members of the free food league they bitterly attacked\\nthe fiscal proposals of mr. chamberlain. when balfour made chamberlain’s\\nfight for fair trade, or for what virtually was protection, a measure\\nof the conservatives, the lines of party began to break, and men were no\\nlonger conservatives or liberals, but protectionists or free traders.\\n\\nagainst this churchill daily protested, against chamberlain, against his\\nplan, against that plan being adopted by the tory party. by tradition,\\nby inheritance, by instinct, churchill was a tory.\\n\\n“i am a tory,” he said, “and i have as much right in the party as has\\nanybody else, certainly as much as certain people from birmingham. they\\ncan’t turn us out, and we, the tory free traders, have as much right\\nto dictate the policy of the conservative party as have any reactionary\\nfair traders.” in 1904 the conservative party already recognized\\nchurchill as one working outside the breastworks. just before the easter\\nvacation of that year, when he rose to speak a remarkable demonstration\\nwas made against him by his unionist colleagues, all of them rising and\\nleaving the house.\\n\\nto the liberals who remained to hear him he stated that if to his\\nconstituents his opinions were obnoxious, he was ready to resign his\\nseat. it then was evident he would go over to the liberal party. some\\nthought he foresaw which way the tidal wave was coming, and to being\\nslapped down on the beach and buried in the sand, he preferred to be\\nswept forward on its crest. others believed he left the conservatives\\nbecause he could not honestly stomach the taxed food offered by mr.\\nchamberlain.\\n\\nin any event, if he were to be blamed for changing from one party to\\nthe other, he was only following the distinguished example set him by\\ngladstone, disraeli, harcourt, and his own father.\\n\\nit was at the time of this change that he was called “the best hated\\nman in england,” but the liberals welcomed him gladly, and the national\\nliberal club paid him the rare compliment of giving in his honor a\\nbanquet. there were present two hundred members. up to that time this\\ndinner was the most marked testimony to his importance in the political\\nworld. it was about then, a year since, that he prophesied: “within\\nnine months there will come such a tide and deluge as will sweep through\\nengland and scotland, and completely wash out and effect a much-needed\\nspring cleaning in downing street.”\\n\\nwhen the deluge came, at manchester, mr. balfour was defeated, and\\nchurchill was victorious, and when the new government was formed the\\ntidal wave landed churchill in the office of under-secretary for the\\ncolonies.\\n\\nwhile this is being written the english papers say that within a\\nmonth he again will be promoted. for this young man of thirty the only\\npromotion remaining is a position in the cabinet, in which august body\\nmen of fifty are considered young.\\n\\nhis is a picturesque career. of any man of his few years speaking our\\nlanguage, his career is probably the most picturesque. and that he is\\nhalf an american gives all of us an excuse to pretend we share in his\\nsuccesses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncaptain philo norton mcgiffin\\n\\nin the chinese-japanese war the battle of the yalu was the first battle\\nfought between warships of modern make, and, except on paper, neither\\nthe men who made them nor the men who fought them knew what the ships\\ncould do, or what they might not do. for years every naval power had\\nbeen building these new engines of war, and in the battle which was to\\ntest them the whole world was interested. but in this battle americans\\nhad a special interest, a human, family interest, for the reason that\\none of the chinese squadron, which was matched against some of the same\\nvessels of japan which lately swept those of russia from the sea, was\\ncommanded by a young graduate of the american naval academy. this young\\nman, who, at the time of the battle of the yalu, was thirty-three years\\nold, was captain philo norton mcgiffin. so it appears that five years\\nbefore our fleet sailed to victory in manila bay another graduate of\\nannapolis, and one twenty years younger than in 1898 was admiral dewey,\\nhad commanded in action a modern battleship, which, in tonnage, in\\narmament, and in the number of the ships’ company, far outclassed\\ndewey’s _olympia_.\\n\\nmcgiffin, who was born on december 13, 1860, came of fighting stock.\\nback in scotland the family is descended from the clan macgregor and the\\nclan macalpine.\\n\\n“these are clan-alpine’s warriors true, and, saxon--i am roderick dhu.”\\n\\nmcgiffin’s great-grandfather, born in scotland, emigrated to this\\ncountry and settled in “little washington,” near pittsburg, pa. in the\\nrevolutionary war he was a soldier. other relatives fought in the war of\\n1812, one of them holding a commission as major. mcgiffin’s own father\\nwas colonel norton mcgiffin, who served in the mexican war, and in\\nthe civil war was lieutenant-colonel of the eighty-fifth pennsylvania\\nvolunteers. so mcgiffin inherited his love for arms.\\n\\nin washington he went to the high school and at the washington jefferson\\ncollege had passed through his freshman year. but the honors that might\\naccrue to him if he continued to live on in the quiet and pretty old\\ntown of washington did not tempt him. to escape into the world he\\nwrote his congressman, begging him to obtain for him an appointment to\\nannapolis. the congressman liked the letter, and wrote colonel mcgiffin\\nto ask if the application of his son had his approval. colonel mcgiffin\\nwas willing, and in 1877 his son received his commission as cadet\\nmidshipman. i knew mcgiffin only as a boy with whom in vacation time i\\nwent coon hunting in the woods outside of washington. for his age he was\\na very tall boy, and in his midshipman undress uniform, to my youthful\\neyes, appeared a most bold and adventurous spirit.\\n\\nat annapolis his record seems to show he was pretty much like other\\nboys. according to his classmates, with all of whom i find he was very\\npopular, he stood high in the practical studies, such as seamanship,\\ngunnery, navigation, and steam engineering, but in all else he was near\\nthe foot of the class, and in whatever escapade was risky and reckless\\nhe was always one of the leaders. to him discipline was extremely\\nirksome. he could maintain it among others, but when it applied to\\nhimself it bored him. on the floor of the academy building on which was\\nhis room there was a pyramid of cannon balls--relics of the war of 1812.\\nthey stood at the head of the stairs, and one warm night, when he could\\nnot sleep, he decided that no one else should do so, and, one by one,\\nrolled the cannon balls down the stairs. they tore away the banisters\\nand bumped through the wooden steps and leaped off into the lower halls.\\nfor any one who might think of ascending to discover the motive power\\nback of the bombardment they were extremely dangerous. but an officer\\napproached mcgiffin in the rear, and, having been caught in the act, he\\nwas sent to the prison ship. there he made good friends with his jailer,\\nan old man-of-warsman named “mike.” he will be remembered by many naval\\nofficers who as midshipmen served on the _santee_. mcgiffin so won\\nover mike that when he left the ship he carried with him six charges of\\ngunpowder. these he loaded into the six big guns captured in the mexican\\nwar, which lay on the grass in the centre of the academy grounds, and at\\nmidnight on the eve of july 1st he fired a salute. it aroused the entire\\ngarrison, and for a week the empty window frames kept the glaziers busy.\\n\\nabout 1878 or 1879 there was a famine in ireland. the people of new york\\ncity contributed provisions for the sufferers, and to carry the supplies\\nto ireland the government authorized the use of the old _constellation_.\\nat the time the voyage was to begin each cadet was instructed to\\nconsider himself as having been placed in command of the _constellation_\\nand to write a report on the preparations made for the voyage, on the\\nloading of the vessel, and on the distribution of the stores. this\\nexercise was intended for the instruction of the cadets; first in the\\nmatter of seamanship and navigation, and second in making official\\nreports. at that time it was a very difficult operation to get a gun out\\nof the port of a vessel where the gun was on a covered deck. to do this\\nthe necessary tackles had to be rigged from the yard-arm and the yard\\nand mast properly braced and stayed, and then the lower block of the\\ntackle carried in through the gun port, which, of course, gave the fall\\na very bad reeve. the first part of mcgiffin’s report dealt with a new\\nmethod of dismounting the guns and carrying them through the gun ports,\\nand so admirable was his plan, so simple and ingenious, that it was\\nused whenever it became necessary to dismount a gun from one of the\\nold sailing ships. having, however, offered this piece of good work,\\nmcgiffin’s report proceeded to tell of the division of the ship into\\ncompartments that were filled with a miscellaneous assortment of stores,\\nwhich included the old “fifteen puzzles,” at that particular time very\\npopular. the report terminated with a description of the joy of the\\nfamished irish as they received the puzzle-boxes. at another time the\\ncadets were required to write a report telling of the suppression of the\\ninsurrection on the isthmus of panama. mcgiffin won great praise for\\nthe military arrangements and disposition of his men, but, in the same\\nreport, he went on to describe how he armed them with a new gun known as\\nbaines’s rhetoric and told of the havoc he wrought in the enemy’s\\nranks when he fired these guns loaded with similes and metaphors and\\nhyperboles.\\n\\nof course, after each exhibition of this sort he was sent to the\\n_santee_ and given an opportunity to meditate.\\n\\non another occasion, when one of the instructors lectured to the cadets,\\nhe required them to submit a written statement embodying all that they\\ncould recall of what had been said at the lecture. one of the rules\\nconcerning this report provided that there should be no erasures or\\ninterlineations, but that when mistakes were made the objectionable or\\nincorrect expressions should be included within parentheses; and that\\nthe matter so enclosed within parentheses would not be considered a part\\nof the report. mcgiffin wrote an excellent _resume_ of the lecture,\\nbut he interspersed through it in parentheses such words as “applause,”\\n “cheers,” “cat-calls,” and “groans,” and as these words were enclosed\\nwithin parentheses he insisted that they did not count, and made a very\\nfair plea that he ought not to be punished for words which slipped in\\nby mistake, and which he had officially obliterated by what he called\\noblivion marks.\\n\\nhe was not always on mischief bent. on one occasion, when the house of a\\nprofessor caught fire, mcgiffin ran into the flames and carried out two\\nchildren, for which act he was commended by the secretary of the navy.\\n\\nit was an act of congress that determined that the career of mcgiffin\\nshould be that of a soldier of fortune. this was a most unjust act,\\nwhich provided that only as many midshipmen should receive commissions\\nas on the warships there were actual vacancies. in those days, in 1884,\\nour navy was very small. to-day there is hardly a ship having her full\\ncomplement of officers, and the difficulty is not to get rid of those we\\nhave educated, but to get officers to educate. to the many boys who, on\\nthe promise that they would be officers of the navy, had worked for\\nfour years at the academy and served two years at sea, the act was most\\nunfair. out of a class of about ninety, only the first twelve were given\\ncommissions and the remaining eighty turned adrift upon the uncertain\\nseas of civil life. as a sop, each was given one thousand dollars.\\n\\nmcgiffin was not one of the chosen twelve. in the final examinations on\\nthe list he was well toward the tail. but without having studied\\nmany things, and without remembering the greater part of them, no\\none graduates from annapolis, even last on the list; and with his one\\nthousand dollars in cash, mcgiffin had also this six years of education\\nat what was then the best naval college in the world. this was his only\\nasset--his education--and as in his own country it was impossible to\\ndispose of it, for possible purchasers he looked abroad.\\n\\nat that time the tong king war was on between france and china, and he\\ndecided, before it grew rusty, to offer his knowledge to the followers\\nof the yellow dragon. in those days that was a hazard of new fortunes\\nthat meant much more than it does now. to-day the east is as near as san\\nfrancisco; the japanese-russian war, our occupation of the philippines,\\nthe part played by our troops in the boxer trouble, have made the\\naffairs of china part of the daily reading of every one. now, one can\\nstep into a brass bed at forty-second street and in four days at the\\ncoast get into another brass bed, and in twelve more be spinning down\\nthe bund of yokohama in a rickshaw. people go to japan for the winter\\nmonths as they used to go to cairo.\\n\\nbut in 1885 it was no such light undertaking, certainly not for a young\\nman who had been brought up in the quiet atmosphere of an inland\\ntown, where generations of his family and other families had lived and\\nintermarried, content with their surroundings.\\n\\nwith very few of his thousand dollars left him, mcgiffin arrived in\\nfebruary, 1885, in san francisco. from there his letters to his family\\ngive one the picture of a healthy, warm-hearted youth, chiefly anxious\\nlest his mother and sister should “worry.” in our country nearly every\\nfamily knows that domestic tragedy when the son and heir “breaks home\\nties,” and starts out to earn a living; and if all the world loves a\\nlover, it at least sympathizes with the boy who is “looking for a job.”\\n the boy who is looking for the job may not think so, but each of those\\nwho has passed through the same hard place gives him, if nothing else,\\nhis good wishes. mcgiffin’s letters at this period gain for him from\\nthose who have had the privilege to read them the warmest good feeling.\\n\\nthey are filled with the same cheery optimism, the same slurring over\\nof his troubles, the same homely jokes, the same assurances that he is\\nfeeling “bully,” and that it all will come out right, that every boy,\\nwhen he starts out in the world, sends back to his mother.\\n\\n“i am in first-rate health and spirits, so i don’t want you to fuss\\nabout me. i am big enough and ugly enough to scratch along somehow, and\\ni will not starve.”\\n\\nto his mother he proudly sends his name written in chinese characters,\\nas he had been taught to write it by the chinese consul-general in san\\nfrancisco, and a pen-picture of two elephants. “i am going to bring you\\nhome _two_ of these,” he writes, not knowing that in the strange and\\nwonderful country to which he is going elephants are as infrequent as\\nthey are in pittsburg.\\n\\nhe reached china in april, and from nagasaki on his way to shanghai\\nthe steamer that carried him was chased by two french gunboats. but,\\napparently much to his disappointment, she soon ran out of range of\\ntheir guns. though he did not know it then, with the enemy he had\\ntravelled so far to fight this was his first and last hostile meeting;\\nfor already peace was in the air.\\n\\nof that and of how, in spite of peace, he obtained the “job” he wanted,\\nhe must tell you himself in a letter home:\\n\\ntien-tsin, china, april 13, 1885.\\n\\n“my dear mother--i have not felt much in the humor for writing, for\\ni did not know what was going to happen. i spent a good deal of money\\ncoming out, and when i got here, i knew, unless something turned up,\\ni was a gone coon. we got off taku forts sunday evening and the next\\nmorning we went inside; the channel is very narrow and sown with\\ntorpedoes. we struck one--an electric one--in coming up, but it didn’t\\ngo off. we were until 10.30 p.m. in coming up to tien-tsin--thirty miles\\nin a straight line, but nearly seventy by the river, which is only about\\none hundred feet wide--and we grounded ten times.\\n\\n“well--at last we moored and went ashore. brace girdle, an engineer, and\\ni went to the hotel, and the first thing we heard was--that _peace was\\ndeclared!_ i went back on board ship, and i didn’t sleep much--i never\\nwas so blue in my life. i knew if they didn’t want me that i might as\\nwell give up the ghost, for i could never get away from china. well--i\\nworried around all night without sleep, and in the morning i felt as\\nif i had been drawn through a knot-hole. i must have lost ten pounds. i\\nwent around about 10 a.m. and gave my letters to pethick, an american\\nu. s. vice-consul and interpreter to li hung chang. he said he would fix\\nthem for me. then i went back to the ship, and as our captain was going\\nup to see li hung chang, i went along out of desperation. we got in,\\nand after a while were taken in through corridor after corridor of the\\nviceroy’s palace until we got into the great li, when we sat down and\\nhad tea and tobacco and talked through an interpreter. when it came\\nmy turn he asked: ‘why did you come to china?’ i said: ‘to enter the\\nchinese service for the war.’ ‘how do you expect to enter?’ ‘i expect\\n_you_ to give me a commission!’ ‘i have no place to offer you.’ ‘i think\\nyou have--i have come all the way from america to get it.’ ‘what would\\nyou like?’ ‘i would like to get the new torpedo-boat and go down the\\nyang-tse-kiang to the blockading squadron.’ ‘will you do that?’ ‘of\\ncourse.’\\n\\n“he thought a little and said: ‘i will see what can be done. will you\\ntake $100 a month for a start?’ i said: ‘that depends.’ (of course\\ni would take it.) well, after parley, he said he would put me on the\\nflagship, and if i did well he would promote me. then he looked at me\\nand said: ‘how old are you?’ when i told him i was twenty-four i thought\\nhe would faint--for in china a man is a _boy_ until he is over thirty.\\nhe said i would _never_ do--i was a child. i could not know anything at\\nall. i could not convince him, but at last he compromised--i was to pass\\nan examination at the arsenal at the naval college, in all branches,\\nand if they passed me i would have a show. so we parted. i reported for\\nexamination next day, but was put off--same the next day. but to-day i\\nwas told to come, and sat down to a stock of foolscap, and had a\\npretty stiff exam. i am only just through. i had seamanship, gunnery,\\nnavigation, nautical astronomy, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, conic\\nsections, curve tracing, differential and integral calculus. i had only\\nthree questions out of five to answer in each branch, but in the first\\nthree i answered all five. after that i only had time for three, but\\nat the end he said i need not finish, he was perfectly satisfied. i had\\ndone remarkably well, and he would report to the viceroy to-morrow. he\\nexamined my first papers--seamanship--said i was _perfect_ in it, so i\\nwill get _along_, you need not fear. i told the consul--he was very well\\npleased--he is a nice man.\\n\\n“i feel pretty well now--have had dinner and am smoking a good manila\\ncheroot. i wrote hard all day, wrote fifteen sheets of foolscap and made\\nabout a dozen drawings--got pretty tired.\\n\\n“i have had a hard scramble for the service and only got in by the\\nskin of my teeth. i guess i will go to bed--i will sleep well\\nto-night--thursday.\\n\\n“i did not hear from the naval secretary, tuesday, so yesterday morning\\ni went up to the admiralty and sent in my card. he came out and received\\nme very well--said i had passed a ‘very splendid examination’; had been\\nrecommended very strongly to the viceroy, who was very much pleased;\\nthat the director of the naval college over at the arsenal had wanted me\\nand would i go over at once? i _would_. it was about five miles. we (a\\nfriend, who is a great rider here) went on steeplechase ponies--we were\\nferried across the pei ho in a small scow and then had a long ride.\\nthere _is_ a path--but pritchard insisted on taking all the ditches,\\nand as my pony jumped like a cat, it wasn’t nice at first, but i didn’t\\nsqueal and kept my seat and got the swing of it at last and rather liked\\nit. i think i will keep a horse here--you can hire one and a servant\\ntogether for $7 a month; that is $5.60 of our money, and pony and man\\nfound in everything.\\n\\n“well--at last we got to the arsenal--a place about four miles around,\\nfortified, where all sorts of arms--cartridges, shot and shell, engines,\\nand _everything_--are made. the naval college is inside surrounded by\\na moat and wall. i thought to myself, if the cadet here is like to the\\nthing i used to be at the u. s. n. a. _that_ won’t keep him in. i went\\nthrough a lot of yards till i was ushered into a room finished in black\\nebony and was greeted very warmly by the director. we took seats on a\\nraised platform--chinese style and pretty soon an interpreter came, one\\nof the chinese professors, who was educated abroad, and we talked and\\ndrank tea. he said i had done well, that he had the authority of the\\nviceroy to take me there as ‘professor’ of seamanship and gunnery; in\\naddition i might be required to teach navigation or nautical astronomy,\\nor drill the cadets in infantry, artillery, and fencing. for this i was\\nto receive what would be in our money $1,800 per annum, as near as we\\ncan compare it, paid in gold each month. besides, i will have a house\\nfurnished for my use, and it is their intention, as soon as i _show_\\nthat i _know_ something, to considerably increase my pay. they asked\\nthe viceroy to give me 130 t per month (about $186) and house, but the\\nviceroy said i was _but a boy_; that i had seen no years and had only\\ncome here a week ago with no one to vouch for me, and that i might turn\\nout an impostor. but he would risk 100 t on me anyhow, and as soon as\\ni was reported favorably on by the college i would be raised--the\\nagreement is to be for three years. for a few months i am to command\\na training ship--an ironclad that is in dry dock at present, until a\\ncaptain in the english navy comes out, who has been sent for to command\\nher.\\n\\n“_so here i am_--twenty-four years old and captain of a man-of-war--a\\nbetter one than any in our own navy--only for a short time, of course,\\nbut i would be a pretty long time before i would command one at home.\\nwell--i accepted and will enter on my duties in a week, as soon as my\\nhouse is put in order. i saw it--it has a long veranda, very broad; with\\nflower garden, apricot trees, etc., just covered with blossoms; a wide\\nhall on the front, a room about 18x15, with a 13-foot ceiling; then back\\nanother rather larger, with a cupola skylight in the centre, where i\\nam going to put a shelf with flowers. the government is to furnish the\\nhouse with bed, tables, chairs, sideboards, lounges, stove for kitchen.\\ni have grates (american) in the room, but i don’t need them. we have\\nsnow, and a good deal of ice in winter, but the thermometer never gets\\nbelow zero. i have to supply my own crockery. i will have two servants\\nand cook; i will only get one and the cook first--they only cost $4\\nto $5.50 per month, and their board amounts to very little. i can get\\nalong, don’t you think so? now i want you to get jim to pack up all\\nmy professional works on gunnery, surveying, seamanship, mathematics,\\nastronomy, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, conic sections, calculus,\\nmechanics, and _every_ book of that description i own, including those\\npaperbound ‘naval institute’ papers, and put them in a box, together\\nwith any photos, etc., you think i would like--i have none of you or pa\\nor the family (including carrie)--and send to me.\\n\\n“i just got in in time--didn’t i? another week would have been too late.\\nmy funds were getting low; i would not have had _anything_ before long.\\nthe u. s. consul, general bromley, is much pleased. the interpreter says\\nit was all in the way i did with the viceroy in the interview.\\n\\n“i will have a chance to go to peking and later to a tiger hunt in\\nmongolia, but for the present i am going to study, work, and _stroke_\\nthese mandarins till i get a raise. i am the only instructor in both\\nseamanship and gunnery, and i must know _everything_, both practically\\nand theoretically. but it will be good for me and the only thing is,\\nthat if i were put back into the navy i would be in a dilemma. i think\\ni will get my ‘influence’ to work, and i want you people at home to\\nlook out, and in case i _am_--if it were represented to the sec. that\\nmy position here was giving me an immense lot of practical knowledge\\nprofessionally--more than i could get on a ship at sea--i think he would\\ngive me two years’ leave on half or quarter pay. or, i would be willing\\nto do without pay--only to be kept on the register in my rank.\\n\\n“i will write more about this. love to all.”\\n\\n\\nit is characteristic of mcgiffin that in the very same letter in which\\nhe announces he has entered foreign service he plans to return to\\nthat of his own country. this hope never left him. you find the same\\nhomesickness for the quarterdeck of an american man-of-war all through\\nhis later letters. at one time a bill to reinstate the midshipmen who\\nhad been cheated of their commissions was introduced into congress. of\\nthis mcgiffin writes frequently as “our bill.” “it may pass,” he writes,\\n“but i am tired hoping. i have hoped so long. and if it should,” he adds\\nanxiously, “there may be a time limit set in which a man must rejoin, or\\nlose his chance, so do not fail to let me know as quickly as you can.”\\n but the bill did not pass, and mcgiffin never returned to the navy that\\nhad cut him adrift. he settled down at tien-tsin and taught the young\\ncadets how to shoot. almost all of those who in the chinese-japanese war\\nserved as officers were his pupils. as the navy grew, he grew with\\nit, and his position increased in importance. more mexican dollars per\\nmonth, more servants, larger houses, and buttons of various honorable\\ncolors were given him, and, in return, he established for china a modern\\nnaval college patterned after our own. in those days throughout china\\nand japan you could find many of these foreign advisers. now, in japan,\\nthe hon. w. h. dennison of the foreign office, one of our own people, is\\nthe only foreigner with whom the japanese have not parted, and in china\\nthere are none. of all of those who have gone none served his employers\\nmore faithfully than did mcgiffin. at a time when every official\\nrobbed the people and the government, and when “squeeze” or “graft”\\n was recognized as a perquisite, mcgiffin’s hands were clean. the shells\\npurchased for the government by him were not loaded with black sand,\\nnor were the rifles fitted with barrels of iron pipe. once a year he\\ncelebrated the thanksgiving day of his own country by inviting to a\\ngreat dinner all the chinese naval officers who had been at least in\\npart educated in america. it was a great occasion, and to enjoy\\nit officers used to come from as far as port arthur, shanghai, and\\nhong-kong. so fully did some of them appreciate the efforts of their\\nhost that previous to his annual dinner, for twenty-four hours, they\\ndelicately starved themselves.\\n\\nduring ten years mcgiffin served as naval constructor and professor\\nof gunnery and seamanship, and on board ships at sea gave practical\\ndemonstrations in the handling of the new cruisers. in 1894 he applied\\nfor leave, which was granted, but before he had sailed for home war with\\njapan was declared and he withdrew his application. he was placed\\nas second in command on board the _chen yuen_, a seven-thousand-ton\\nbattleship, a sister ship to the _ting yuen_, the flagship of admiral\\nting ju chang. on the memorable 17th of september, 1894, the battle of\\nthe yalu was fought, and so badly were the chinese vessels hammered that\\nthe chinese navy, for the time being, was wiped out of existence.\\n\\nfrom the start the advantage was with the japanese fleet. in heavy guns\\nthe chinese were the better armed, but in quick-firing guns the japanese\\nwere vastly superior, and while the chinese battleships _ting yuen_ and\\n_chen yuen_, each of 7,430 tons, were superior to any of the japanese\\nwarships, the three largest of which were each of 4,277 tons, the gross\\ntonnage of the japanese fleet was 36,000 to 21,000 of the chinese.\\nduring the progress of the battle the ships engaged on each side\\nnumbered an even dozen, but at the very start, before a decisive shot\\nwas fired by either contestant, the _tsi yuen_, 2,355 tons, and _kwan\\nchiae_, 1,300 tons, ran away, and before they had time to get into the\\ngame the _chao yung_ and _yang wei_ were in flames and had fled to the\\nnearest land. so the battle was fought by eight chinese ships against\\ntwelve of the japanese. of the chinese vessels, the flagship, commanded\\nby admiral ting, and her sister ship, which immediately after the\\nbeginning of the fight was for four hours commanded by mcgiffin, were\\nthe two chief aggressors, and in consequence received the fire of the\\nentire japanese squadron. toward the end of the fight, which without\\ninterruption lasted for five long hours, the japanese did not even\\nconsider the four smaller ships of the enemy, but, sailing around the\\ntwo ironclads in a circle, fired only at them. the japanese themselves\\ntestified that these two ships never lost their formation, and that\\nwhen her sister ironclad was closely pressed the _chen yuen_, by her\\nmovements and gun practice, protected the _ting yuen_, and, in fact,\\nwhile she could not prevent the heavy loss the fleet encountered,\\npreserved it from annihilation. during the fight this ship was almost\\ncontinuously on fire, and was struck by every kind of projectile, from\\nthe thirteen-inch canet shells to a rifle bullet, four hundred times.\\nmcgiffin himself was so badly wounded, so beaten about by concussions,\\nso burned, and so bruised by steel splinters, that his health and\\neyesight were forever wrecked. but he brought the _chen yuen_ safely\\ninto port arthur and the remnants of the fleet with her.\\n\\non account of his lack of health he resigned from the chinese service\\nand returned to america. for two years he lived in new york city,\\nsuffering in body without cessation the most exquisite torture. during\\nthat time his letters to his family show only tremendous courage. on the\\nsplintered, gaping deck of the _chen yuen_, with the fires below it,\\nand the shells bursting upon it, he had shown to his chinese crew the\\ncourage of the white man who knew he was responsible for them and for\\nthe honor of their country. but far greater and more difficult was the\\ncourage he showed while alone in the dark sick-room, and in the private\\nwards of the hospitals.\\n\\nin the letters he dictates from there he still is concerned only lest\\nthose at home shall “worry”; he reassures them with falsehoods, jokes\\nat their fears; of the people he can see from the window of the hospital\\ntells them foolish stories; for a little boy who has been kind he asks\\nthem to send him his chinese postage stamps; he plans a trip he will\\ntake with them when he is stronger, knowing he never will be stronger.\\nthe doctors had urged upon him a certain operation, and of it to a\\nfriend he wrote: “i know that i will have to have a piece about three\\ninches square cut out of my skull, and this nerve cut off near the\\nmiddle of the brain, as well as my eye taken out (for a couple of hours\\nonly, provided it is not mislaid, and can be found). doctor ------ and\\nhis crowd show a bad memory for failures. as a result of this operation\\nothers have told me--i forget the percentage of deaths, which does not\\nmatter, but--that a large percentage have become insane. and some lost\\ntheir sight.”\\n\\nwhile threatened with insanity and complete blindness, and hourly from\\nhis wounds suffering a pain drugs could not master, he dictated for the\\n_century magazine_ the only complete account of the battle of the yalu.\\nin a letter to mr. richard watson gilder he writes: “...my eyes are\\ntroubling me. i cannot see even what i am writing now, and am getting\\nthe article under difficulties. i yet hope to place it in your hands by\\nthe 21st, still, if my eyes grow worse------”\\n\\n“still, if my eyes grow worse------”\\n\\nthe unfinished sentence was grimly prophetic.\\n\\nunknown to his attendants at the hospital, among the papers in his\\ndespatch-box he had secreted his service revolver. on the morning of the\\n11th of february, 1897, he asked for this box, and on some pretext sent\\nthe nurse from the room. when the report of the pistol brought them\\nrunning to his bedside, they found the pain-driven body at peace, and\\nthe tired eyes dark forever.\\n\\nin the article in the _century_ on the battle of the yalu, he had said:\\n\\n“chief among those who have died for their country is admiral ting ju\\nchang, a gallant soldier and true gentleman. betrayed by his countrymen,\\nfighting against odds, almost his last official act was to stipulate\\nfor the lives of his officers and men. his own he scorned to save, well\\nknowing that his ungrateful country would prove less merciful than his\\nhonorable foe. bitter, indeed, must have been the reflections of the\\nold, wounded hero, in that midnight hour, as he drank the poisoned cup\\nthat was to give him rest.”\\n\\nand bitter indeed must have been the reflections of the young wounded\\namerican, robbed, by the parsimony of his country, of the right he had\\nearned to serve it, and who was driven out to give his best years and\\nhis life for a strange people under a strange flag.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngeneral william walker,\\n\\nthe king of the filibusters\\n\\nit is safe to say that to members of the younger generation the name of\\nwilliam walker conveys absolutely nothing. to them, as a name, “william\\nwalker” awakens no pride of race or country. it certainly does not\\nsuggest poetry and adventure. to obtain a place in even this group\\nof soldiers of fortune, william walker, the most distinguished of all\\namerican soldiers of fortune, the one who but for his own countrymen\\nwould have single-handed attained the most far-reaching results, had to\\nwait his turn behind adventurers of other lands and boy officers of\\nhis own. and yet had this man with the plain name, the name that\\nto-day means nothing, accomplished what he adventured, he would on this\\ncontinent have solved the problem of slavery, have established an empire\\nin mexico and in central america, and, incidentally, have brought us\\ninto war with all of europe. that is all he would have accomplished.\\n\\nin the days of gold in san francisco among the “forty-niners” william\\nwalker was one of the most famous, most picturesque and popular figures.\\njack oakhurst, gambler; colonel starbottle, duellist; yuba bill,\\nstage-coach driver, were his contemporaries. bret harte was one of his\\nkeenest admirers, and in two of his stories, thinly disguised under a\\nmore appealing name, walker is the hero. when, later, walker came to new\\nyork city, in his honor broadway from the battery to madison square was\\nbedecked with flags and arches. “it was roses, roses all the way.” the\\nhouse-tops rocked and swayed.\\n\\nin new orleans, where in a box at the opera he made his first\\nappearance, for ten minutes the performance came to a pause, while the\\naudience stood to salute him.\\n\\nthis happened less than fifty years ago, and there are men who as boys\\nwere out with “walker of nicaragua,” and who are still active in the\\npublic life of san francisco and new york.\\n\\nwalker was born in 1824, in nashville, tenn. he was the oldest son of\\na scotch banker, a man of a deeply religious mind, and interested in\\na business which certainly is removed, as far as possible, from\\nthe profession of arms. indeed, few men better than william walker\\nillustrate the fact that great generals are born, not trained.\\neverything in walker’s birth, family tradition, and education pointed\\nto his becoming a member of one of the “learned” professions. it was\\nthe wish of his father that he should be a minister of the presbyterian\\nchurch, and as a child he was trained with that end in view. he himself\\npreferred to study medicine, and after graduating at the university of\\ntennessee, at edinburgh he followed a course of lectures, and for two\\nyears travelled in europe, visiting many of the great hospitals.\\n\\nthen having thoroughly equipped himself to practise as a physician,\\nafter a brief return to his native city, and as short a stay in\\nphiladelphia, he took down his shingle forever, and proceeded to\\nnew orleans to study law. in two years he was admitted to the bar of\\nlouisiana. but because clients were few, or because the red tape of the\\nlaw chafed his spirit, within a year, as already he had abandoned\\nthe church and medicine, he abandoned his law practice and became\\nan editorial writer on the new orleans _crescent_. a year later the\\nrestlessness which had rebelled against the grave professions led him to\\nthe gold fields of california, and san francisco. there, in 1852, at\\nthe age of only twenty-eight, as editor of the san francisco _herald_,\\nwalker began his real life which so soon was to end in both disaster and\\nglory.\\n\\nup to his twenty-eighth year, except in his restlessness, nothing in his\\nlife foreshadowed what was to follow. nothing pointed to him as a man\\nfor whom thousands of other men, from every capital of the world, would\\ngive up their lives.\\n\\nnegatively, by abandoning three separate callings, and in making it\\nplain that a professional career did not appeal to him, walker had\\nthrown a certain sidelight on his character; but actively he never had\\ngiven any hint that under the thoughtful brow of the young doctor and\\nlawyer there was a mind evolving schemes of empire, and an ambition\\nlimited only by the two great oceans.\\n\\nwalker’s first adventure was undoubtedly inspired by and in imitation\\nof one which at the time of his arrival in san francisco had just been\\nbrought to a disastrous end. this was the de boulbon expedition into\\nmexico. the count gaston raoulx de raousset-boulbon was a young french\\nnobleman and soldier of fortune, a _chasseur d’afrique_, a duellist,\\njournalist, dreamer, who came to california to dig gold. baron\\nharden-hickey, who was born in san francisco a few years after boulbon\\nat the age of thirty was shot in mexico, also was inspired to dreams of\\nconquest by this same gentleman adventurer.\\n\\nboulbon was a young man of large ideas. in the rapid growth of\\ncalifornia he saw a threat to mexico and proposed to that government, as\\na “buffer” state between the two republics, to form a french colony\\nin the mexican state of sonora. sonora is that part of mexico which\\ndirectly joins on the south with our state of arizona. the president of\\nmexico gave boulbon permission to attempt this, and in 1852 he landed at\\nguaymas in the gulf of california with two hundred and sixty well-armed\\nfrenchmen. the ostensible excuse of boulbon for thus invading foreign\\nsoil was his contract with the president under which his “emigrants”\\n were hired to protect other foreigners working in the “restauradora”\\n mines from the attacks of apache indians from our own arizona. but there\\nis evidence that back of boulbon was the french government, and that\\nhe was attempting, in his small way, what later was attempted by\\nmaximilian, backed by a french army corps and louis napoleon, to\\nestablish in mexico an empire under french protection. for both the\\nfilibuster and the emperor the end was the same; to be shot by the\\nfusillade against a church wall.\\n\\nin 1852, two years before boulbon’s death, which was the finale to his\\nsecond filibustering expedition into sonora, he wrote to a friend in\\nparis: “europeans are disturbed by the growth of the united states. and\\nrightly so. unless she be dismembered; unless a powerful rival be built\\nup beside her (_i.e._, france in mexico), america will become, through\\nher commerce, her trade, her population, her geographical position upon\\ntwo oceans, the inevitable mistress of the world. in ten years europe\\ndare not fire a shot without her permission. as i write fifty americans\\nprepare to sail for mexico and go perhaps to victory. _voila les\\netats-unis_.”\\n\\nthese fifty americans who, in the eyes of boulbon, threatened the peace\\nof europe, were led by the ex-doctor, ex-lawyer, ex-editor, william\\nwalker, _aged twenty-eight years_. walker had attempted but had failed\\nto obtain from the mexican government such a contract as the one it had\\ngranted de boulbon. he accordingly sailed without it, announcing that,\\nwhether the mexican government asked him to do so or not, he would see\\nthat the women and children on the border of mexico and arizona were\\nprotected from massacre by the indians. it will be remembered that when\\ndr. jameson raided the transvaal he also went to protect “women and\\nchildren” from massacre by the boers. walker’s explanation of his\\nexpedition, in his own words, is as follows. he writes in the third\\nperson: “what walker saw and heard satisfied him that a comparatively\\nsmall body of americans might gain a position on the sonora frontier\\nand protect the families on the border from the indians, and such an\\nact would be one of humanity whether or not sanctioned by the mexican\\ngovernment. the condition of the upper part of sonora was at that time,\\nand still is [he was writing eight years later, in 1860], a disgrace to\\nthe civilization of the continent...and the people of the united states\\nwere more immediately responsible before the world for the apache\\noutrages. northern sonora was in fact, more under the dominion of the\\napaches than under the laws of mexico, and the contributions of the\\nindians were collected with greater regularity and certainty than the\\ndues of the tax-gatherers. the state of this region furnished the best\\ndefence for any american aiming to settle there without the formal\\nconsent of mexico; and, although political changes would certainly have\\nfollowed the establishment of a colony, they might be justified by the\\nplea that any social organization, no matter how secured, is preferable\\nto that in which individuals and families are altogether at the mercy of\\nsavages.”\\n\\nwhile at the time of jameson’s raid the women and children in danger of\\nmassacre from the boers were as many as there are snakes in ireland, at\\nthe time of walker’s raid the women and children were in danger from the\\nindians, who as enemies, as walker soon discovered, were as cruel and as\\ngreatly to be feared as he had described them.\\n\\nbut it was not to save women and children that walker sought to conquer\\nthe state of sonora. at the time of his expedition the great question of\\nslavery was acute; and if in the states next to be admitted to the union\\nslavery was to be prohibited, the time had come, so it seemed to\\nthis statesman of twenty-eight years, when the south must extend her\\nboundaries, and for her slaves find an outlet in fresh territory.\\nsonora already joined arizona. by conquest her territory could easily\\nbe extended to meet texas. as a matter of fact, strategically the spot\\nselected by william walker for the purpose for which he desired it was\\nalmost perfect. throughout his brief career one must remember that the\\nspring of all his acts was this dream of an empire where slavery would\\nbe recognized. his mother was a slave-holder. in tennessee he had been\\nborn and bred surrounded by slaves. his youth and manhood had been spent\\nin nashville and new orleans. he believed as honestly, as fanatically\\nin the right to hold slaves as did his father in the faith of the\\ncovenanters. to-day one reads his arguments in favor of slavery with the\\nmost curious interest. his appeal to the humanity of his reader, to his\\nheart, to his sense of justice, to his fear of god, and to his belief\\nin the holy bible not to abolish slavery, but to continue it, to this\\ngeneration is as amusing as the topsy-turvyisms of gilbert or shaw. but\\nto the young man himself slavery was a sacred institution, intended for\\nthe betterment of mankind, a god-given benefit to the black man and a\\ngod-given right of his white master.\\n\\nwhite brothers in the south, with perhaps less exalted motives,\\ncontributed funds to fit out walker’s expedition, and in october, 1852,\\nwith forty-five men, he landed at cape st. lucas, at the extreme point\\nof lower california. lower california, it must be remembered, in spite\\nof its name, is not a part of our california, but then was, and still\\nis, a part of mexico. the fact that he was at last upon the soil of the\\nenemy caused walker to throw off all pretence; and instead of hastening\\nto protect women and children, he sailed a few miles farther up the\\ncoast to la paz. with his forty-five followers he raided the town, made\\nthe governor a prisoner, and established a republic with himself as\\npresident. in a proclamation he declared the people free of the tyranny\\nof mexico. they had no desire to be free, but walker was determined,\\nand, whether they liked it or not, they woke up to find themselves an\\nindependent republic. a few weeks later, although he had not yet set\\nfoot there, walker annexed on paper the state of sonora, and to both\\nstates gave the name of the republic of sonora.\\n\\nas soon as word of this reached san francisco, his friends busied\\nthemselves in his behalf, and the danger-loving and adventurous of\\nall lands were enlisted as “emigrants” and shipped to him in the bark\\n_anita_.\\n\\ntwo months later, in november, 1852, three hundred of these joined\\nwalker. they were as desperate a band of scoundrels as ever robbed a\\nsluice, stoned a chinaman, or shot a “greaser.” when they found that to\\ncommand them there was only a boy, they plotted to blow up the\\nmagazine in which the powder was stored, rob the camp, and march north,\\nsupporting themselves by looting the ranches. walker learned of their\\nplot, tried the ringleaders by court-martial, and shot them. with a\\nforce as absolutely undisciplined as was his, the act required the most\\ncomplete personal courage. that was a quality the men with him could\\nfully appreciate. they saw they had as a leader one who could fight,\\nand one who would punish. the majority did not want a leader who would\\npunish so when walker called upon those who would follow him to sonora\\nto show their hands, only the original forty-five and about forty of\\nthe later recruits remained with him. with less than one hundred men\\nhe started to march up the peninsula through lower california, and so\\naround the gulf to sonora.\\n\\nfrom the very start the filibusters were overwhelmed with disaster. the\\nmexicans, with indian allies, skulked on the flanks and rear. men who\\nin the almost daily encounters were killed fell into the hands of the\\nindians, and their bodies were mutilated. stragglers and deserters were\\nrun to earth and tortured. those of the filibusters who were wounded\\ndied from lack of medical care. the only instruments they possessed with\\nwhich to extract the arrow-heads were probes made from ramrods filed to\\na point. their only food was the cattle they killed on the march. the\\narmy was barefoot, the cabinet in rags, the president of sonora wore one\\nboot and one shoe.\\n\\nunable to proceed farther, walker fell back upon san vincente, where he\\nhad left the arms and ammunition of the deserters and a rear-guard of\\neighteen men. he found not one of these to welcome him. a dozen had\\ndeserted, and the mexicans had surprised the rest, lassoing them and\\ntorturing them until they died. walker now had but thirty-five men. to\\nwait for further re-enforcements from san francisco, even were he sure\\nthat re-enforcements would come, was impossible. he determined by forced\\nmarches to fight his way to the boundary line of california. between him\\nand safety were the mexican soldiers holding the passes, and the indians\\nhiding on his flanks. when within three miles of the boundary line, at\\nsan diego, colonel melendrez, who commanded the mexican forces, sent in\\na flag of truce, and offered, if they would surrender, a safe-conduct to\\nall of the survivors of the expedition except the chief. but the men who\\nfor one year had fought and starved for walker, would not, within three\\nmiles of home, abandon him.\\n\\nmelendrez then begged the commander of the united states troops to order\\nwalker to surrender. major mckinstry, who was in command of the united\\nstates army post at san diego, refused. for him to cross the line would\\nbe a violation of neutral territory. on mexican soil he would neither\\nembarrass the ex-president of sonora nor aid him; but he saw to it that\\nif the filibusters reached american soil, no mexican or indian should\\nfollow them.\\n\\naccordingly, on the imaginary boundary he drew up his troop, and like\\nan impartial umpire awaited the result. hidden behind rocks and cactus,\\nacross the hot, glaring plain, the filibusters could see the american\\nflag, and the gay, fluttering guidons of the cavalry. the sight gave\\nthem heart for one last desperate spurt. melendrez also appreciated\\nthat for the final attack the moment had come. as he charged, walker,\\napparently routed, fled, but concealed in the rocks behind him he had\\nstationed a rear-guard of a dozen men. as melendrez rode into this\\nambush the dozen riflemen emptied as many saddles, and the mexicans and\\nindians stampeded. a half hour later, footsore and famished, the little\\nband that had set forth to found an empire of slaves, staggered across\\nthe line and surrendered to the forces of the united states.\\n\\nof this expedition james jeffrey roche says, in his “byways of war,”\\n which is of all books published about walker the most intensely and\\nfascinatingly interesting and complete: “years afterward the peon\\nherdsman or prowling cocupa indian in the mountain by-paths stumbled\\nover the bleaching skeleton of some nameless one whose resting-place was\\nmarked by no cross or cairn, but the colts revolver resting beside\\nhis bones spoke his country and his occupation--the only relic of the\\nwould-be conquistadores of the nineteenth century.”\\n\\nunder parole to report to general wood, commanding the department of the\\npacific, the filibusters were sent by sailing vessel to san francisco,\\nwhere their leader was tried for violating the neutrality laws of the\\nunited states, and acquitted.\\n\\nwalker’s first expedition had ended in failure, but for him it had been\\nan opportunity of tremendous experience, as active service is the best\\nof all military academies, and for the kind of warfare he was to wage,\\nthe best preparation. nor was it inglorious, for his fellow survivors,\\ncontrary to the usual practice, instead of in bar-rooms placing the\\nblame for failure upon their leader, stood ready to fight one and all\\nwho doubted his ability or his courage. later, after five years, many of\\nthese same men, though ten to twenty years his senior, followed him to\\ndeath, and never questioned his judgment nor his right to command.\\n\\nat this time in nicaragua there was the usual revolution. on the\\nsouth the sister republic of costa rica was taking sides, on the north\\nhonduras was landing arms and men. there was no law, no government. a\\ndozen political parties, a dozen commanding generals, and not one strong\\nman.\\n\\nin the editorial rooms of the san francisco _herald_, walker, searching\\nthe map for new worlds to conquer, rested his finger upon nicaragua.\\n\\nin its confusion of authority he saw an opportunity to make himself\\na power, and in its tropical wealth and beauty, in the laziness and\\nincompetence of its inhabitants, he beheld a greater, fairer, more kind\\nsonora. on the pacific side from san francisco he could re-enforce his\\narmy with men and arms; on the caribbean side from new orleans he could,\\nwhen the moment arrived, people his empire with slaves.\\n\\nthe two parties at war in nicaragua were the legitimists and the\\ndemocrats. why they were at war it is not necessary to know. probably\\nwalker did not know; it is not likely that they themselves knew. but\\nfrom the leader of the democrats walker obtained a contract to bring\\nto nicaragua three hundred americans, who were each to receive several\\nhundred acres of land, and who were described as “colonists liable to\\nmilitary duty.” this contract walker submitted to the attorney-general\\nof the state and to general wood, who once before had acquitted him of\\nfilibustering; and neither of these federal officers saw anything\\nwhich seemed to give them the right to interfere. but the rest of san\\nfrancisco was less credulous, and the “colonists” who joined walker\\nhad a very distinct idea that they were not going to nicaragua to plant\\ncoffee or to pick bananas.\\n\\nin may, 1855, just a year after walker and his thirty-three followers\\nhad surrendered to the united states troops at san diego, with fifty new\\nrecruits and seven veterans of the former expedition he sailed from\\nsan francisco in the brig _vesta_, and in five weeks, after a weary and\\nstormy voyage, landed at realejo. there he was met by representatives of\\nthe provisional director of the democrats, who received the californians\\nwarmly.\\n\\nwalker was commissioned a colonel, achilles kewen, who had been fighting\\nunder lopez in cuba, a lieutenant-colonel, and timothy crocker, who had\\nserved under walker in the sonora expedition, a major. the corps\\nwas organized as an independent command and was named “la falange\\namericana.” at this time the enemy held the route to the caribbean, and\\nwalker’s first orders were to dislodge him.\\n\\naccordingly, a week after landing with his fifty-seven americans and one\\nhundred and fifty native troops, walker sailed in the _vesta_ for brito,\\nfrom which port he marched upon rivas, a city of eleven thousand people\\nand garrisoned by some twelve hundred of the enemy.\\n\\nthe first fight ended in a complete and disastrous fiasco. the native\\ntroops ran away, and the americans surrounded by six hundred of the\\nlegitimists’ soldiers, after defending themselves for three hours behind\\nsome adobe huts, charged the enemy and escaped into the jungle. their\\nloss was heavy, and among the killed were the two men upon whom walker\\nchiefly depended: kewen and crocker. the legitimists placed the bodies\\nof the dead and wounded who were still living on a pile of logs and\\nburned them. after a painful night march, walker, the next day, reached\\nsan juan on the coast, and, finding a costa rican schooner in port,\\nseized it for his use. at this moment, although walker’s men were\\ndefeated, bleeding, and in open flight, two “gringos” picked up on\\nthe beach of san juan, “the texan harry mcleod and the irishman peter\\nburns,” asked to be permitted to join him.\\n\\n“it was encouraging,” walker writes, “for the soldiers to find that\\nsome besides themselves did not regard their fortunes as altogether\\ndesperate, and small as was this addition to their number it gave\\nincreased moral as well as material strength to the command.”\\n\\nsometimes in reading history it would appear as though for success the\\nfirst requisite must be an utter lack of humor, and inability to look\\nupon what one is attempting except with absolute seriousness. with forty\\nmen walker was planning to conquer and rule nicaragua, a country with a\\npopulation of two hundred and fifty thousand souls and as large as the\\ncombined area of massachusetts, vermont, rhode island, new hampshire,\\nand connecticut. and yet, even seven years later, he records without\\na smile that two beach-combers gave his army “moral and material\\nstrength.” and it is most characteristic of the man that at the\\nmoment he was rejoicing over this addition to his forces, to maintain\\ndiscipline two americans who had set fire to the houses of the enemy\\nhe ordered to be shot. a weaker man would have repudiated the two\\namericans, who, in fact, were not members of the phalanx, and trusted\\nthat their crimes would not be charged against him. but the success of\\nwalker lay greatly in his stern discipline. he tried the men, and they\\nconfessed to their guilt. one got away; and, as it might appear that\\nwalker had connived at his escape, to the second man was shown no\\nmercy. when one reads how severe was walker in his punishments, and\\nhow frequently the death penalty was invoked by him against his own\\nfew followers, the wonder grows that these men, as independent and as\\nunaccustomed to restraint as were those who first joined him, submitted\\nto his leadership. one can explain it only by the personal quality of\\nwalker himself.\\n\\namong these reckless, fearless outlaws, who, despising their allies,\\nbelieved and proved that with his rifle one american could account for a\\ndozen nicaraguans, walker was the one man who did not boast or drink or\\ngamble, who did not even swear, who never looked at a woman, and who, in\\nmoney matters, was scrupulously honest and unself-seeking. in a fight,\\nhis followers knew that for them he would risk being shot just as\\nunconcernedly as to maintain his authority he would shoot one of them.\\n\\ntreachery, cowardice, looting, any indignity to women, he punished with\\ndeath; but to the wounded, either of his own or of the enemy’s forces,\\nhe was as gentle as a nursing sister and the brave and able he rewarded\\nwith instant promotion and higher pay. in no one trait was he a\\ndemagogue. one can find no effort on his part to ingratiate himself with\\nhis men. among the officers of his staff there were no favorites. he\\nmessed alone, and at all times kept to himself. he spoke little, and\\nthen with utter lack of self-consciousness. in the face of injustice,\\nperjury, or physical danger, he was always calm, firm, dispassionate.\\nbut it is said that on those infrequent occasions when his anger\\nasserted itself, the steady steel-gray eyes flashed so menacingly that\\nthose who faced them would as soon look down the barrel of his colt.\\n\\nthe impression one gets of him gathered from his recorded acts, from his\\nown writings, from the writings of those who fought with him, is of a\\nsilent, student-like young man believing religiously in his “star of\\ndestiny”; but, in all matters that did not concern himself, possessed of\\na grim sense of fun. the sayings of his men that in his history of the\\nwar he records, show a distinct appreciation of the bret harte school of\\nhumor. as, for instance, when he tells how he wished to make one of them\\na drummer boy and the californian drawled: “no, thanks, colonel; i never\\nseen a picture of a battle yet that the first thing in it wasn’t a dead\\ndrummer boy with a busted drum.”\\n\\nin walker the personal vanity which is so characteristic of the soldier\\nof fortune was utterly lacking. in a land where a captain bedecks\\nhimself like a field-marshal, walker wore his trousers stuffed in his\\nboots, a civilian’s blue frock-coat, and the slouch hat of the period,\\nwith, for his only ornament, the red ribbon of the democrats. the\\nauthority he wielded did not depend upon braid or buttons, and only when\\ngoing into battle did he wear his sword. in appearance he was slightly\\nbuilt, rather below the medium height, smooth shaven, and with deep-set\\ngray eyes. these eyes apparently, as they gave him his nickname, were\\nhis most marked feature.\\n\\nhis followers called him, and later, when he was thirty-two years\\nold, he was known all over the united states as the “gray-eyed man of\\ndestiny.”\\n\\nfrom the first walker recognized that in order to establish himself in\\nnicaragua he must keep in touch with all possible recruits arriving from\\nsan francisco and new york, and that to do this he must hold the line\\nof transit from the caribbean sea to the pacific. at this time the sea\\nroutes to the gold-fields were three: by sailing vessel around the cape,\\none over the isthmus of panama, and one, which was the shortest, across\\nnicaragua. by a charter from the government of nicaragua, the right to\\ntransport passengers across this isthmus was controlled by the accessory\\ntransit company, of which the first cornelius vanderbilt was president.\\nhis company owned a line of ocean steamers both on the pacific side\\nand on the atlantic side. passengers _en route_ from new york to the\\ngold-fields were landed by these latter steamers at greytown on the west\\ncoast of nicaragua, and sent by boats of light draught up the san juan\\nriver to lake nicaragua. there they were met by larger lake steamers and\\nconveyed across the lake to virgin bay. from that point, in carriages\\nand on mule back, they were carried twelve miles overland to the port of\\nsan juan del sud on the pacific coast, where they boarded the company’s\\nsteamers to san francisco.\\n\\nduring the year of walker’s occupation the number of passengers crossing\\nnicaragua was an average of about two thousand a month.\\n\\nit was to control this route that immediately after his first defeat\\nwalker returned to san juan del sud, and in a smart skirmish defeated\\nthe enemy and secured possession of virgin bay, the halting place for\\nthe passengers going east or west. in this fight walker was outnumbered\\nfive to one, but his losses were only three natives killed and a few\\namericans wounded. the legitimists lost sixty killed and a hundred\\nwounded. this proportion of losses shows how fatally effective was the\\nrifle and revolver fire of the californians. indeed, so wonderful was it\\nthat when some years ago i visited the towns and cities captured by the\\nfilibusters, i found that the marksmanship of walker’s phalanx was still\\na tradition. indeed, thanks to the filibusters, to-day in any part of\\ncentral america a man from the states, if in trouble, has only to show\\nhis gun. no native will wait for him to fire it.\\n\\nafter the fight at virgin bay, walker received from california fifty\\nrecruits--a very welcome addition to his force, and as he now commanded\\nabout one hundred and twenty americans, three hundred nicaraguans, under\\na friendly native, general valle, and two brass cannon, he decided to\\nagain attack rivas. rivas is on the lake just above virgin bay; still\\nfurther up is granada, which was the head-quarters of the legitimists.\\n\\nfearing walker’s attack upon rivas, the legitimist troops were hurried\\nsouth from granada to that city, leaving granada but slightly protected.\\n\\nthrough intercepted letters walker learned of this and determined to\\nstrike at granada. by night, in one of the lake steamers, he skirted the\\nshore, and just before daybreak, with fires banked and all lights out,\\ndrew up to a point near the city. the day previous the legitimists had\\ngained a victory, and, as good luck or walker’s “destiny” would have\\nit, the night before granada had been celebrating the event. much joyous\\ndancing and much drinking of aguardiente had buried the inhabitants in a\\ndrugged slumber. the garrison slept, the sentries slept, the city slept.\\nbut when the convent bells called for early mass, the air was shaken\\nwith sharp reports that to the ears of the legitimists were unfamiliar\\nand disquieting. they were not the loud explosions of their own muskets\\nnor of the smooth bores of the democrats. the sounds were sharp and\\ncruel like the crack of a whip. the sentries flying from their posts\\ndisclosed the terrifying truth. “the filibusteros!” they cried.\\nfollowing them at a gallop came walker and valle and behind them the men\\nof the awful phalanx, whom already the natives had learned to fear: the\\nbearded giants in red flannel shirts who at rivas on foot had charged\\nthe artillery with revolvers, who at virgin bay when wounded had drawn\\nfrom their boots glittering bowie knives and hurled them like arrows,\\nwho at all times shot with the accuracy of the hawk falling upon a\\nsquawking hen.\\n\\nthere was a brief terrified stand in the plaza, and then a complete\\nrout. as was their custom, the native democrats began at once to loot\\nthe city. but walker put his sword into the first one of these he met,\\nand ordered the americans to arrest all others found stealing, and to\\nreturn the goods already stolen. over a hundred political prisoners in\\nthe cartel were released by walker, and the ball and chain to which each\\nwas fastened stricken off. more than two-thirds of them at once enlisted\\nunder walker’s banner.\\n\\nhe now was in a position to dictate to the enemy his own terms of peace,\\nbut a fatal blunder on the part of parker h. french, a lieutenant of\\nwalker’s, postponed peace for several weeks, and led to unfortunate\\nreprisals. french had made an unauthorized and unsuccessful assault\\non san carlos at the eastern end of the lake, and the legitimists\\nretaliated at virgin bay by killing half a dozen peaceful passengers,\\nand at san carlos by firing at a transit steamer. for this the excuse of\\nthe legitimists was, that now that walker was using the lake steamers\\nas transports it was impossible for them to know whether the boats were\\noccupied by his men or neutral passengers. as he could not reach the\\nguilty ones, walker held responsible for their acts their secretary\\nof state, who at the taking of granada was among the prisoners. he was\\ntried by court-martial and shot, “a victim of the new interpretation of\\nthe principles of constitutional government.” while this act of walker’s\\nwas certainly stretching the theory of responsibility to the breaking\\npoint, its immediate effect was to bring about a hasty surrender and a\\nmeeting between the generals of the two political parties. thus, four\\nmonths after walker and his fifty-seven followers landed in nicaragua,\\na suspension of hostilities was arranged, and the side for which the\\namericans had fought was in power. walker was made commander-in-chief\\nof an army of twelve hundred men with salary of six thousand dollars a\\nyear. a man named rivas was appointed temporary president.\\n\\nto walker this pause in the fight was most welcome. it gave him an\\nopportunity to enlist recruits and to organize his men for the better\\naccomplishment of what was the real object of his going to nicaragua. he\\nnow had under him a remarkable force, one of the most effective known\\nto military history. for although six months had not yet passed,\\nthe organization he now commanded was as unlike the phalanx of\\nthe fifty-eight adventurers who were driven back at rivas, as were\\nfalstaff’s followers from the regiment of picked men commanded by\\ncolonel roosevelt. instead of the undisciplined and lawless now being\\nin the majority, the ranks were filled with the pick of the california\\nmining camps, with veterans of the mexican war, with young southerners\\nof birth and spirit, and with soldiers of fortune from all of the great\\narmies of europe.\\n\\nin the civil war, which so soon followed, and later in the service of\\nthe khedive of egypt, were several of walker’s officers, and for years\\nafter his death there was no war in which one of the men trained by him\\nin the jungles of nicaragua did not distinguish himself. in his memoirs,\\nthe englishman, general charles frederic henningsen, writes that though\\nhe had taken part in some of the greatest battles of the civil war he\\nwould pit a thousand men of walker’s command against any five thousand\\nconfederate or union soldiers. and general henningsen was one who spoke\\nwith authority. before he joined walker he had served in spain under don\\ncarlos, in hungary under kossuth, and in bulgaria.\\n\\nof walker’s men, a regiment of which he commanded, he writes: “i often\\nhave seen them march with a broken or compound fractured arm in\\nsplints, and using the other to fire the rifle or revolver. those with a\\nfractured thigh or wounds which rendered them incapable of removal, shot\\nthemselves. such men do not turn up in the average of everyday life, nor\\ndo i ever expect to see their like again. all military science failed\\non a suddenly given field before such assailants, who came at a run\\nto close with their revolvers and who thought little of charging a gun\\nbattery, pistol in hand.”\\n\\nanother graduate of walker’s army was captain fred townsend ward, a\\nnative of salem, mass., who after the death of walker organized and\\nled the ever victorious army that put down the tai-ping rebellion,\\nand performed the many feats of martial glory for which chinese gordon\\nreceived the credit. in shanghai, to the memory of the filibuster, there\\nare to-day two temples in his honor.\\n\\njoaquin miller, the poet, miner, and soldier, who but recently was a\\npicturesque figure on the hotel porch at saratoga springs, was one of\\nthe young californians who was “out with walker,” and who later in\\nhis career by his verse helped to preserve the name of his beloved\\ncommander. i. c. jamison, living to-day in guthrie, oklahoma, was a\\ncaptain under walker. when war again came, as it did within four months,\\nthese were the men who made walker president of nicaragua.\\n\\nduring the four months in all but title he had been president, and as\\nsuch he was recognized and feared. it was against him, not rivas, that\\nin february, 1856, the neighboring republic of costa rica declared war.\\nfor three months this war continued with varying fortunes until the\\ncosta ricans were driven across the border.\\n\\nin june of the same year rivas called a general election for president,\\nannouncing himself as the candidate of the democrats. two other\\ndemocrats also presented themselves, salazar and ferrer. the\\nlegitimists, recognizing in their former enemy the real ruler of the\\ncountry, nominated walker. by an overwhelming majority he was elected,\\nreceiving 15,835 votes to 867 cast for rivas. salazar received 2,087;\\nferrer, 4,447.\\n\\nwalker now was the legal as well as the actual ruler of the country,\\nand at no time in its history, as during walker’s administration, was\\nnicaragua governed so justly, so wisely, and so well. but in his success\\nthe neighboring republics saw a menace to their own independence. to the\\nfour other republics of central america the five-pointed blood-red star\\non the flag of the filibusters bore a sinister motto: “five or none.”\\n the meaning was only too unpleasantly obvious. at once, costa rica on\\nthe south, and guatemala, salvador, and honduras from the north, with\\nthe malcontents of nicaragua, declared war against the foreign invader.\\nagain walker was in the field with opposed to him 21,000 of the allies.\\nthe strength of his own force varied. on his election as president the\\nbackbone of his army was a magnificently trained body of veterans to the\\nnumber of 2,000. this was later increased to 3,500, but it is doubtful\\nif at any one time it ever exceeded that number. his muster and hospital\\nrolls show that during his entire occupation of nicaragua there were\\nenlisted, at one time or another, under his banner 10,000 men. while in\\nhis service, of this number, by hostile shots or fever, 5,000 died.\\n\\nto describe the battles with the allies would be interminable and\\nwearying. in every particular they are much alike: the long silent\\nnight march, the rush at daybreak, the fight to gain strategic\\npositions either of the barracks, or of the cathedral in the plaza,\\nthe hand-to-hand fighting from behind barricades and adobe walls. the\\nout-come of these fights sometimes varied, but the final result was\\nnever in doubt, and had no outside influences intervened, in time each\\nrepublic in central america would have come under the five-pointed star.\\n\\nin costa rica there is a marble statue showing that republic represented\\nas a young woman with her foot upon the neck of walker. some night a\\ntruth-loving american will place a can of dynamite at the foot of that\\nstatue, and walk hurriedly away. unaided, neither costa rica nor any\\nother central american republic could have driven walker from her soil.\\nhis downfall came through his own people, and through an act of his\\nwhich provoked them.\\n\\nwhen walker was elected president he found that the accessory transit\\ncompany had not lived up to the terms of its concession with the\\nnicaraguan government. his efforts to hold it to the terms of its\\nconcession led to his overthrow. by its charter the transit company\\nagreed to pay to nicaragua ten thousand dollars annually and ten per\\ncent. of the net profits; but the company, whose history the united\\nstates minister, squire, characterized as “an infamous career of\\ndeception and fraud,” manipulated its books in such a fashion as to\\nshow that there never were any profits. doubting this, walker sent a\\ncommission to new york to investigate. the commission discovered the\\nfraud and demanded in back payments two hundred and fifty thousand\\ndollars. when the company refused to pay this, as security for the\\ndebt walker seized its steamers, wharves, and storehouses, revoked its\\ncharter, and gave a new charter to two of its directors, morgan and\\ngarrison, who, in san francisco, were working against vanderbilt. in\\ndoing this, while he was legally in the right, he committed a fatal\\nerror. he had made a powerful enemy of vanderbilt, and he had shut off\\nhis only lines of communication with the united states. for, enraged\\nat the presumption of the filibuster president, vanderbilt withdrew his\\nocean steamers, thus leaving walker without men or ammunition, and as\\nisolated as though upon a deserted island. he possessed vanderbilt’s\\nboats upon the san juan river and nicaragua lake, but they were of use\\nto him only locally.\\n\\nhis position was that of a man holding the centre span of a bridge of\\nwhich every span on either side of him has been destroyed.\\n\\nvanderbilt did not rest at withdrawing his steamers, but by supporting\\nthe costa ricans with money and men, carried the war into central\\namerica. from washington he fought walker through secretary of state\\nmarcy, who proved a willing tool.\\n\\nspencer and webster, and the other soldiers of fortune employed by\\nvanderbilt, closed the route on the caribbean side, and the man-of-war\\n_st. marys_, commanded by captain davis, was ordered to san juan on the\\npacific side. the instructions given to captain davis were to aid the\\nallies in forcing walker out of nicaragua. walker claims that these\\norders were given to marcy by vanderbilt and by marcy to commodore\\nmervin, who was marcy’s personal friend and who issued them to davis.\\ndavis claims that he acted only in the interest of humanity to save\\nwalker in spite of himself. in any event, the result was the same.\\nwalker, his force cut down by hostile shot and fever and desertion, took\\nrefuge in rivas, where he was besieged by the allied armies. there was\\nno bread in the city. the men were living on horse and mule meat. there\\nwas no salt. the hospital was filled with wounded and those stricken\\nwith fever.\\n\\ncaptain davis, in the name of humanity, demanded walker’s surrender to\\nthe united states. walker told him he would not surrender, but that\\nif the time came when he found he must fly, he would do so in his own\\nlittle schooner of war, the _granada_, which constituted his entire\\nnavy, and in her, as a free man, take his forces where he pleased. then\\ndavis informed walker that the force walker had sent to recapture the\\ngreytown route had been defeated by the janizaries of vanderbilt; that\\nthe steamers from san francisco, on which walker now counted to bring\\nhim re-enforcements, had also been taken off the line, and finally\\nthat it was his “unalterable and deliberate intention” to seize the\\n_granada_. on this point his orders left him no choice. the _granada_\\nwas the last means of transportation still left to walker. he had hoped\\nto make a sortie and on board her to escape from the country. but with\\nhis ship taken from him and no longer able to sustain the siege of\\nthe allies, he surrendered to the forces of the united states. in the\\nagreement drawn up by him and davis, walker provided for the care, by\\ndavis, of the sick and wounded, for the protection after his departure\\nof the natives who had fought with him, and for the transportation of\\nhimself and officers to the united states.\\n\\non his arrival in new york he received a welcome such as later was\\nextended to kossuth, and, in our own day, to admiral dewey. the city\\nwas decorated with flags and arches; and banquets, fetes, and public\\nmeetings were everywhere held in his honor. walker received these\\ndemonstrations modestly, and on every public occasion announced his\\ndetermination to return to the country of which he was the president,\\nand from which by force he had been driven. at washington, where he\\nwent to present his claims, he received scant encouragement. his protest\\nagainst captain davis was referred to congress, where it was allowed to\\ndie.\\n\\nwithin a month walker organized an expedition with which to regain his\\nrights in nicaragua, and as, in his new constitution for that country,\\nhe had annulled the old law abolishing slavery, among the slave-holders\\nof the south he found enough money and recruits to enable him to at once\\nleave the united states. with one hundred and fifty men he sailed from\\nnew orleans and landed at san del norte on the caribbean side. while he\\nformed a camp on the harbor of san juan, one of his officers, with fifty\\nmen, proceeded up the river and, capturing the town of castillo viejo\\nand four of the transit steamers, was in a fair way to obtain possession\\nof the entire route. at this moment upon the scene arrived the united\\nstates frigate _wabash_ and hiram paulding, who landed a force of three\\nhundred and fifty blue-jackets with howitzers, and turned the guns of\\nhis frigate upon the camp of the president of nicaragua. captain engel,\\nwho presented the terms of surrender to walker, said to him: “general,\\ni am sorry to see you here. a man like you is worthy to command better\\nmen.” to which walker replied grimly: “if i had a third the number you\\nhave brought against me, i would show you which of us two commands the\\nbetter men.”\\n\\nfor the third time in his history walker surrendered to the armed forces\\nof his own country.\\n\\non his arrival in the united states, in fulfilment of his parole to\\npaulding, walker at once presented himself at washington a prisoner\\nof war. but president buchanan, although paulding had acted exactly as\\ndavis had done, refused to support him, and in a message to congress\\ndeclared that that officer had committed a grave error and established\\nan unsafe precedent.\\n\\non the strength of this walker demanded of the united states government\\nindemnity for his losses, and that it should furnish him and his\\nfollowers transportation even to the very camp from which its\\nrepresentatives had torn him. this demand, as walker foresaw, was not\\nconsidered seriously, and with a force of about one hundred men, among\\nwhom were many of his veterans, he again set sail from new orleans.\\nowing to the fact that, to prevent his return, there now were on each\\nside of the isthmus both american and british men-of-war, walker, with\\nthe idea of reaching nicaragua by land, stopped off at honduras. in his\\nwar with the allies the honduranians had been as savage in their attacks\\nupon his men as even the costa ricans, and finding his old enemies\\nnow engaged in a local revolution, on landing, walker declared for the\\nweaker side and captured the important seaport of trujillo. he no sooner\\nhad taken it than the british warship _icarus_ anchored in the harbor,\\nand her commanding officer, captain salmon, notified walker that the\\nbritish government held a mortgage on the revenues of the port, and that\\nto protect the interests of his government he intended to take the town.\\nwalker answered that he had made trujillo a free port, and that great\\nbritain’s claims no longer existed.\\n\\nthe british officer replied that if walker surrendered himself and his\\nmen he would carry them as prisoners to the united states, and that if\\nhe did not, he would bombard the town. at this moment general alvarez,\\nwith seven hundred honduranians, from the land side surrounded trujillo,\\nand prepared to attack. against such odds by sea and land walker was\\nhelpless, and he determined to fly. that night, with seventy men,\\nhe left the town and proceeded down the coast toward nicaragua. the\\n_icarus_, having taken on board alvarez, started in pursuit. the\\npresident of nicaragua was found in a little indian fishing village, and\\nsalmon sent in his shore-boats and demanded his surrender. on leaving\\ntrujillo, walker had been forced to abandon all his ammunition save\\nthirty rounds a man, and all of his food supplies excepting two barrels\\nof bread. on the coast of this continent there is no spot more unhealthy\\nthan honduras, and when the englishmen entered the fishing village they\\nfound walker’s seventy men lying in the palm huts helpless with fever,\\nand with no stomach to fight british blue-jackets with whom they had no\\nquarrel. walker inquired of salmon if he were asking him to surrender to\\nthe british or to the honduranian forces, and twice salmon assured him,\\n“distinctly and specifically,” that he was surrendering to the forces of\\nher majesty. with this understanding walker and his men laid down their\\narms and were conveyed to the _icarus_. but on arriving at trujillo,\\nin spite of their protests and demands for trial by a british tribunal,\\nsalmon turned over his prisoners to the honduranian general. what excuse\\nfor this is now given by his descendants in the salmon family i do not\\nknow.\\n\\nprobably it is a subject they avoid, and, in history, salmon’s version\\nhas never been given, which for him, perhaps, is an injustice. but the\\nfact remains that he turned over his white brothers to the mercies of\\nhalf-indian, half-negro, savages, who were not allies of great britain,\\nand in whose quarrels she had no interest. and salmon did this, knowing\\nthere could be but one end. if he did not know it, his stupidity\\nequalled what now appears to be heartless indifference. so far as to\\nsecure pardon for all except the leader and one faithful follower,\\ncolonel rudler of the famous phalanx, salmon did use his authority, and\\nhe offered, if walker would ask as an american citizen, to intercede for\\nhim. but walker, with a distinct sense of loyalty to the country he had\\nconquered, and whose people had honored him with their votes, refused to\\naccept life from the country of his birth, the country that had injured\\nand repudiated him.\\n\\neven in his extremity, abandoned and alone on a strip of glaring coral\\nand noisome swamp land, surrounded only by his enemies, he remained true\\nto his ideal.\\n\\nat thirty-seven life is very sweet, many things still seem possible, and\\nbefore him, could his life be spared, walker beheld greater conquests,\\nmore power, a new south controlling a nicaragua canal, a network of\\nbusy railroads, great squadrons of merchant vessels, himself emperor of\\ncentral america. on the gunboat the gold-braided youth had but to raise\\nhis hand, and walker again would be a free man. but the gold-braided one\\nwould render this service only on the condition that walker would appeal\\nto him as an american; it was not enough that walker was a human being.\\nthe condition walker could not grant.\\n\\n“the president of nicaragua,” he said, “is a citizen of nicaragua.”\\n\\nthey led him out at sunrise to a level piece of sand along the beach,\\nand as the priest held the crucifix in front of him he spoke to his\\nexecutioners in spanish, simply and gravely: “i die a roman catholic.\\nin making war upon you at the invitation of the people of ruatan i\\nwas wrong. of your people i ask pardon. i accept my punishment with\\nresignation. i would like to think my death will be for the good of\\nsociety.”\\n\\nfrom a distance of twenty feet three soldiers fired at him, but,\\nalthough each shot took effect, walker was not dead. so, a sergeant\\nstooped, and with a pistol killed the man who would have made him one of\\nan empire of slaves.\\n\\nhad walker lived four years longer to exhibit upon the great board of\\nthe civil war his ability as a general, he would, i believe, to-day be\\nranked as one of america’s greatest fighting men.\\n\\nand because the people of his own day destroyed him is no reason that we\\nshould withhold from this american, the greatest of all filibusters, the\\nrecognition of his genius.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmajor burnham, chief of scouts\\n\\namong the soldiers of fortune whose stories have been told in this book\\nwere men who are no longer living, men who, to the united states, are\\nstrangers, and men who were of interest chiefly because in what they\\nattempted they failed.\\n\\nthe subject of this article is none of these. his adventures are as\\nremarkable as any that ever led a small boy to dig behind the barn for\\nburied treasure, or stalk indians in the orchard. but entirely apart\\nfrom his adventures he obtains our interest because in what he has\\nattempted he has not failed, because he is one of our own people, one of\\nthe earliest and best types of american, and because, so far from being\\ndead and buried, he is at this moment very much alive, and engaged in\\nmexico in searching for a buried city. for exercise, he is alternately\\nchasing, or being chased by, yaqui indians.\\n\\nin his home in pasadena, cal., where sometimes he rests quietly for\\nalmost a week at a time, the neighbors know him as “fred” burnham. in\\nengland the newspapers crowned him “the king of scouts.” later, when he\\nwon an official title, they called him “major frederick russell burnham,\\nd. s. o.”\\n\\nsome men are born scouts, others by training become scouts. from his\\nfather burnham inherited his instinct for wood-craft, and to this\\ninstinct, which in him is as keen as in a wild deer or a mountain lion,\\nhe has added, in the jungle and on the prairie and mountain ranges,\\nyears of the hardest, most relentless schooling. in those years he has\\ntrained himself to endure the most appalling fatigues, hunger, thirst,\\nand wounds; has subdued the brain to infinite patience, has learned to\\nforce every nerve in his body to absolute obedience, to still even the\\nbeating of his heart. indeed, than burnham no man of my acquaintance to\\nmy knowledge has devoted himself to his life’s work more earnestly, more\\nhonestly, and with such single-mindedness of purpose. to him scouting\\nis as exact a study as is the piano to paderewski, with the result that\\nto-day what the pole is to other pianists, the american is to all other\\n“trackers,” woodmen, and scouts. he reads “the face of nature” as you\\nread your morning paper. to him a movement of his horse’s ears is as\\nplain a warning as the “go slow” of an automobile sign; and he so saves\\nfrom ambush an entire troop. in the glitter of a piece of quartz in the\\nfirelight he discovers king solomon’s mines. like the horned cattle, he\\ncan tell by the smell of it in the air the near presence of water,\\nand where, glaring in the sun, you can see only a bare kopje, he\\ndistinguishes the muzzle of a pompom, the crown of a boer sombrero,\\nthe levelled barrel of a mauser. he is the sherlock holmes of all\\nout-of-doors.\\n\\nbesides being a scout, he is soldier, hunter, mining expert, and\\nexplorer. within the last ten years the educated instinct that as a\\nyounger man taught him to follow the trail of an indian, or the “spoor”\\n of the kaffir and the trek wagon, now leads him as a mining expert to\\nthe hiding-places of copper, silver, and gold, and, as he advises, great\\nand wealthy syndicates buy or refuse tracts of land in africa and mexico\\nas large as the state of new york. as an explorer in the last few years\\nin the course of his expeditions into undiscovered lands, he has added\\nto this little world many thousands of square miles.\\n\\npersonally, burnham is as unlike the scout of fiction, and of the wild\\nwest show, as it is possible for a man to be. he possesses no flowing\\nlocks, his talk is not of “greasers,” “grizzly b’ars,” or “pesky\\nredskins.” in fact, because he is more widely and more thoroughly\\ninformed, he is much better educated than many who have passed through\\none of the “big three” universities, and his english is as conventional\\nas though he had been brought up on the borders of boston common, rather\\nthan on the borders of civilization.\\n\\nin appearance he is slight, muscular, bronzed; with a finely formed\\nsquare jaw, and remarkable light blue eyes. these eyes apparently never\\nleave yours, but in reality they see everything behind you and about\\nyou, above and below you. they tell of him that one day, while out with\\na patrol on the veldt, he said he had lost the trail and, dismounting,\\nbegan moving about on his hands and knees, nosing the ground like a\\nbloodhound, and pointing out a trail that led back over the way the\\nforce had just marched. when the commanding officer rode up, burnham\\nsaid:\\n\\n“don’t raise your head, sit. on that kopje to the right there is a\\ncommando of boers.”\\n\\n“when did you see them?” asked the officer.\\n\\n“i see them now,” burnham answered.\\n\\n“but i thought you were looking for a lost trail?”\\n\\n“that’s what the boers on the kopje think,” said burnham.\\n\\nin his eyes, possibly, owing to the uses to which they have been\\ntrained, the pupils, as in the eyes of animals that see in the dark,\\nare extremely small. even in the photographs that accompany this article\\nthis feature of his eyes is obvious, and that he can see in the dark\\nthe kaffirs of south africa firmly believe. in manner he is quiet,\\ncourteous, talking slowly but well, and, while without any of that\\nshyness that comes from self-consciousness, extremely modest. indeed,\\nthere could be no better proof of his modesty than the difficulties i\\nhave encountered in gathering material for this article, which i have\\nbeen five years in collecting. and even now, as he reads it by his\\ncamp-fire, i can see him squirm with embarrassment.\\n\\nburnham’s father was a pioneer missionary in a frontier hamlet called\\ntivoli on the edge of the indian reserve of minnesota. he was a stern,\\nseverely religious man, born in kentucky, but educated in new york,\\nwhere he graduated from the union theological seminary. he was\\nwonderfully skilled in wood-craft. burnham’s mother was a miss rebecca\\nrussell of a well-known family in iowa. she was a woman of great\\ncourage, which, in those days on that skirmish line of civilization,\\nwas a very necessary virtue; and she was possessed of a most gentle and\\nsweet disposition. that was her gift to her son fred, who was born on\\nmay 11, 1861.\\n\\nhis education as a child consisted in memorizing many verses of the\\nbible, the “three r’s,” and wood-craft. his childhood was strenuous. in\\nhis mother’s arms he saw the burning of the town of new ulm, which was\\nthe funeral pyre for the women and children of that place when they were\\nmassacred by red cloud and his braves.\\n\\non another occasion fred’s mother fled for her life from the indians,\\ncarrying the boy with her. he was a husky lad, and knowing that if she\\ntried to carry him farther they both would be overtaken, she hid him\\nunder a shock of corn. there, the next morning, the indians having been\\ndriven off, she found her son sleeping as soundly as a night watchman.\\nin these indian wars, and the civil war which followed, of the families\\nof burnham and russell, twenty-two of the men were killed. there is no\\nquestion that burnham comes of fighting stock.\\n\\nin 1870, when fred was nine years old, his father moved to los angeles,\\ncal., where two years later he died; and for a time for both mother and\\nboy there was poverty, hard and grinding. to relieve this young burnham\\nacted as a mounted messenger. often he was in the saddle from twelve to\\nfifteen hours, and even in a land where every one rode well, he gained\\nlocal fame as a hard rider. in a few years a kind uncle offered to mrs.\\nburnham and a younger brother a home in the east, but at the last moment\\nfred refused to go with them, and chose to make his own way. he was then\\nthirteen years old, and he had determined to be a scout.\\n\\nat that particular age many boys have set forth determined to be scouts,\\nand are generally brought home the next morning by a policeman. but\\nburnham, having turned his back on the cities, did not repent. he\\nwandered over mexico, arizona, california. he met indians, bandits,\\nprospectors, hunters of all kinds of big game; and finally a scout who,\\nunder general taylor, had served in the mexican war. this man took a\\nliking to the boy; and his influence upon him was marked and for his\\ngood. he was an educated man, and had carried into the wilderness a few\\nbooks. in the cabin of this man burnham read “the conquest of mexico\\nand peru” by prescott, the lives of hannibal and cyrus the great, of\\nlivingstone the explorer, which first set his thoughts toward africa,\\nand many technical works on the strategy and tactics of war. he had no\\nexperience of military operations on a large scale, but, with the aid of\\nthe veteran of the mexican war, with corn-cobs in the sand in front of\\nthe cabin door, he constructed forts and made trenches, redoubts,\\nand traverses. in burnham’s life this seems to have been a very happy\\nperiod. the big game he hunted and killed he sold for a few dollars to\\nthe men of nadean’s freight outfits, which in those days hauled bullion\\nfrom cerro gordo for the man who is now senator jones of nevada.\\n\\nat nineteen burnham decided that there were things in this world he\\nshould know that could not be gleaned from the earth, trees, and sky;\\nand with the few dollars he had saved he came east. the visit apparently\\nwas not a success. the atmosphere of the town in which he went to school\\nwas strictly puritanical, and the townspeople much given to religious\\ndiscussion. the son of the pioneer missionary found himself unable to\\nsubscribe to the formulas which to the others seemed so essential, and\\nhe returned to the west with the most bitter feelings, which lasted\\nuntil he was twenty-one.\\n\\n“it seems strange now,” he once said to me, “but in those times\\nreligious questions were as much a part of our daily life as to-day are\\nautomobiles, the standard oil, and the insurance scandals, and when i\\nwent west i was in an unhappy, doubting frame of mind. the trouble was\\ni had no moral anchors; the old ones father had given me were gone, and\\nthe time for acquiring new ones had not arrived.” this bitterness of\\nheart, or this disappointment, or whatever the state of mind was that\\nthe dogmas of the new england town had inspired in the boy from the\\nprairie, made him reckless. for the life he was to lead this was not a\\nhandicap. even as a lad, in a land-grant war in california, he had been\\nunder gunfire, and for the next fifteen years he led a life of danger\\nand of daring; and studied in a school of experience than which, for a\\nscout, if his life be spared, there can be none better. burnham came\\nout of it a quiet, manly, gentleman. in those fifteen years he roved the\\nwest from the great divide to mexico. he fought the apache indians for\\nthe possession of waterholes, he guarded bullion on stage-coaches, for\\ndays rode in pursuit of mexican bandits and american horse thieves,\\ntook part in county-seat fights, in rustler wars, in cattle wars; he was\\ncowboy, miner, deputy-sheriff, and in time throughout the the name of\\n“fred” burnham became significant and familiar.\\n\\nduring this period burnham was true to his boyhood ideal of becoming a\\nscout. it was not enough that by merely living the life around him he\\nwas being educated for it. he daily practised and rehearsed those things\\nwhich some day might mean to himself and others the difference between\\nlife and death. to improve his sense of smell he gave up smoking, of\\nwhich he was extremely fond, nor, for the same reason, does he to this\\nday use tobacco. he accustomed himself also to go with little sleep, and\\nto subsist on the least possible quantity of food. as a deputy-sheriff\\nthis educated faculty of not requiring sleep aided him in many important\\ncaptures. sometimes he would not strike the trail of the bandit or “bad\\nman” until the other had several days the start of him. but the end\\nwas the same; for, while the murderer snatched a few hours’ rest by the\\ntrail, burnham, awake and in the saddle, would be closing up the miles\\nbetween them.\\n\\nthat he is a good marksman goes without telling. at the age of eight his\\nfather gave him a rifle of his own, and at twelve, with either a “gun”\\n or a winchester, he was an expert. he taught himself to use a weapon\\neither in his left or right hand and to shoot, indian fashion, hanging\\nby one leg from his pony and using it as a cover, and to turn in the\\nsaddle and shoot behind him. i once asked him if he really could shoot\\nto the rear with a galloping horse under him and hit a man.\\n\\n“well,” he said, “maybe not to hit him, but i can come near enough to\\nhim to make him decide my pony’s so much faster than his that it really\\nisn’t worth while to follow me.”\\n\\nbesides perfecting himself in what he tolerantly calls “tricks” of\\nhorsemanship and marksmanship, he studied the signs of the trail, forest\\nand prairie, as a sailing-master studies the waves and clouds. the\\nknowledge he gathers from inanimate objects and dumb animals seems\\nlittle less than miraculous. and when you ask him how he knows these\\nthings he always gives you a reason founded on some fact or habit of\\nnature that shows him to be a naturalist, mineralogist, geologist, and\\nbotanist, and not merely a seventh son of a seventh son.\\n\\nin south africa he would say to the officers: “there are a dozen boers\\nfive miles ahead of us riding basuto ponies at a trot, and leading five\\nothers. if we hurry we should be able to sight them in an hour.” at\\nfirst the officers would smile, but not after a half-hour’s gallop, when\\nthey would see ahead of them a dozen boers leading five ponies. in the\\nearly days of salem, burnham would have been burned as a witch.\\n\\nwhen twenty-three years of age he married miss blanche blick, of iowa.\\nthey had known each other from childhood, and her brothers-in-law have\\nbeen burnham’s aids and companions in every part of africa and the west.\\nneither at the time of their marriage nor since did mrs. burnham “lay\\na hand on the bridle rein,” as is witnessed by the fact that for nine\\nyears after his marriage burnham continued his career as sheriff, scout,\\nmining prospector. and in 1893, when burnham and his brother-in-law,\\ningram, started for south africa, mrs. burnham went with them, and\\nin every part of south africa shared her husband’s life of travel and\\ndanger.\\n\\nin making this move across the sea, burnham’s original idea was to look\\nfor gold in the territory owned by the german east african company. but\\nas in rhodesia the first matabele uprising had broken out, he continued\\non down the coast, and volunteered for that campaign. this was the real\\nbeginning of his fortunes. the “war” was not unlike the indian fighting\\nof his early days, and although the country was new to him, with\\nthe kind of warfare then being waged between the kaffirs under king\\nlobengula and the white settlers of the british south africa company,\\nthe chartered company of cecil rhodes, he was intimately familiar.\\n\\nit does not take big men long to recognize other big men, and burnham’s\\nremarkable work as a scout at once brought him to the notice of rhodes\\nand dr. jameson, who was personally conducting the campaign. the war was\\ntheir own private war, and to them, at such a crisis in the history of\\ntheir settlement, a man like burnham was invaluable.\\n\\nthe chief incident of this campaign, the fame of which rang over all\\ngreat britain and her colonies, was the gallant but hopeless stand made\\nby major alan wilson and his patrol of thirty-four men. it was burnham’s\\nattempt to save these men that made him known from buluwayo to cape\\ntown.\\n\\nking lobengula and his warriors were halted on one bank of the shangani\\nriver, and on the other major forbes, with a picked force of three\\nhundred men, was coming up in pursuit. although at the moment he did\\nnot know it, he also was being pursued by a force of matabeles, who were\\ngradually surrounding him. at nightfall major wilson and a patrol of\\ntwelve men, with burnham and his brother-in-law, ingram, acting as\\nscouts, were ordered to make a dash into the camp of lobengula and, if\\npossible, in the confusion of their sudden attack, and under cover of a\\nterrific thunder-storm that was raging, bring him back a prisoner.\\n\\nwith the king in their hands the white men believed the rebellion would\\ncollapse. to the number of three thousand the matabeles were sleeping in\\na succession of camps, through which the fourteen men rode at a gallop.\\nbut in the darkness it was difficult to distinguish the trek wagon of\\nthe king, and by the time they found his laager the matabeles from the\\nother camps through which they had ridden had given the alarm. through\\nthe underbrush from every side the enemy, armed with assegai and\\nelephant guns, charged toward them and spread out to cut off their\\nretreat.\\n\\nat a distance of about seven hundred yards from the camps there was\\na giant ant-hill, and the patrol rode toward it. by the aid of the\\nlightning flashes they made their way through a dripping wood and over\\nsoil which the rain had turned into thick black mud. when the party\\ndrew rein at the ant-hill it was found that of the fourteen three were\\nmissing. as the official scout of the patrol and the only one who could\\nsee in the dark, wilson ordered burnham back to find them. burnham said\\nhe could do so only by feeling the hoof-prints in the mud and that he\\nwould like some one with him to lead his pony. wilson said he would lead\\nit. with his fingers burnham followed the trail of the eleven horses to\\nwhere, at right angles, the hoof-prints of the three others separated\\nfrom it, and so came upon the three men. still, with nothing but the mud\\nof the jungle to guide him, he brought them back to their comrades. it\\nwas this feat that established his reputation among british, boers, and\\nblack men in south africa.\\n\\nthroughout the night the men of the patrol lay in the mud holding the\\nreins of their horses. in the jungle about them, they could hear the\\nenemy splashing through the mud, and the swishing sound of the branches\\nas they swept back into place. it was still raining. just before\\nthe dawn there came the sounds of voices and the welcome clatter of\\naccoutrements. the men of the patrol, believing the column had joined\\nthem, sprang up rejoicing, but it was only a second patrol, under\\ncaptain borrow, who had been sent forward with twenty men as\\nre-enforcements. they had come in time to share in a glorious\\nimmortality. no sooner had these men joined than the kaffirs began the\\nattack; and the white men at once learned that they were trapped in a\\ncomplete circle of the enemy. hidden by the trees, the kaffirs fired\\npoint-blank, and in a very little time half of wilson’s force was\\nkilled or wounded. as the horses were shot down the men used them for\\nbreastworks. there was no other shelter. wilson called burnham to him\\nand told him he must try and get through the lines of the enemy to\\nforbes.\\n\\n“tell him to come up at once,” he said; “we are nearly finished.” he\\ndetailed a trooper named gooding and ingram to accompany burnham.\\n“one of you may get through,” he said. gooding was but lately out from\\nlondon, and knew nothing of scouting, so burnham and ingram warned him,\\nwhether he saw the reason for it or not, to act exactly as they did.\\nthe three men had barely left the others before the enemy sprang at them\\nwith their spears. in five minutes they were being fired at from every\\nbush. then followed a remarkable ride, in which burnham called to his\\naid all he had learned in thirty years of border warfare. as the enemy\\nrushed after them, the three doubled on their tracks, rode in triple\\nloops, hid in dongas to breathe their horses; and to scatter their\\npursuers, separated, joined again, and again separated. the enemy\\nfollowed them to the very bank of the river, where, finding the “drift”\\n covered with the swollen waters, they were forced to swim. they reached\\nthe other bank only to find forbes hotly engaged with another force of\\nthe matabeles.\\n\\n“i have been sent for re-enforcements,” burnham said to forbes, “but i\\nbelieve we are the only survivors of that party.” forbes himself was too\\nhard pressed to give help to wilson, and burnham, his errand over, took\\nhis place in the column, and began firing upon the new enemy.\\n\\nsix weeks later the bodies of wilson’s patrol were found lying in a\\ncircle. each of them had been shot many times. a son of lobengula, who\\nwitnessed their extermination, and who in buluwayo had often heard the\\nenglishmen sing their national anthem, told how the five men who were\\nthe last to die stood up and, swinging their hats defiantly, sang “god\\nsave the queen.” the incident will long be recorded in song and story;\\nand in london was reproduced in two theatres, in each of which the\\nman who played “burnham, the american scout,” as he rode off for\\nre-enforcements, was as loudly cheered by those in the audience as by\\nthose on the stage.\\n\\nhensman, in his “history of rhodesia,” says: “one hardly knows which to\\nmost admire, the men who went on this dangerous errand, through brush\\nswarming with natives, or those who remained behind battling against\\noverwhelming odds.”\\n\\nfor his help in this war the chartered company presented burnham with\\nthe campaign medal, a gold watch engraved with words of appreciation;\\nand at the suggestion of cecil rhodes gave him, ingram, and the hon.\\nmaurice clifford, jointly, a tract of land of three hundred square\\nacres.\\n\\nafter this campaign burnham led an expedition of ten white men and\\nseventy kaffirs north of the zambesi river to explore barotzeland\\nand other regions to the north of mashonaland, and to establish the\\nboundaries of the concession given him, ingram, and clifford.\\n\\nin order to protect burnham on the march the chartered company signed\\na treaty with the native king of the country through which he wished\\nto travel, by which the king gave him permission to pass freely and\\nguaranteed him against attack.\\n\\nbut latea, the son of the king, refused to recognize the treaty and sent\\nhis young men in great numbers to surround burnham’s camp. burnham had\\nbeen instructed to avoid a fight, and was torn between his desire to\\nobey the chartered company and to prevent a massacre. he decided to make\\nit a sacrifice either of himself or of latea. as soon as night fell,\\nwith only three companions and a missionary to act as a witness of what\\noccurred, he slipped through the lines of latea’s men, and, kicking\\ndown the fence around the prince’s hut, suddenly appeared before him and\\ncovered him with his rifle.\\n\\n“is it peace or war?” burnham asked. “i have the king your father’s\\nguarantee of protection, but your men surround us. i have told my people\\nif they hear shots to open fire. we may all be killed, but you will be\\nthe first to die.”\\n\\nthe missionary also spoke urging latea to abide by the treaty. burnham\\nsays the prince seemed much more impressed by the arguments of the\\nmissionary than by the fact that he still was covered by burnham’s\\nrifle. whichever argument moved him, he called off his warriors. on\\nthis expedition burnham discovered the ruins of great granite structures\\nfifteen feet wide, and made entirely without mortar. they were of a\\nperiod dating before the phoenicians. he also sought out the ruins\\ndescribed to him by f. c. selous, the famous hunter, and by rider\\nhaggard as king solomon’s mines. much to the delight of mr. haggard,\\nhe brought back for him from the mines of his imagination real gold\\nornaments and a real gold bar.\\n\\non this same expedition, which lasted five months, burnham endured one\\nof the severest hardships of his life. alone with ten kaffir boys, he\\nstarted on a week’s journey across the dried-up basin of what once had\\nbeen a great lake. water was carried in goat-skins on the heads of the\\nbearers. the boys, finding the bags an unwieldy burden, and believing,\\nwith the happy optimism of their race, that burnham’s warnings were\\nneedless, and that at a stream they soon could refill the bags, emptied\\nthe water on the ground.\\n\\nthe tortures that followed this wanton waste were terrible. five of\\nthe boys died, and after several days, when burnham found water in\\nabundance, the tongues of the others were so swollen that their jaws\\ncould not meet.\\n\\non this trip burnham passed through a region ravaged by the “sleeping\\nsickness,” where his nostrils were never free from the stench of dead\\nbodies, where in some of the villages, as he expressed it, “the hyenas\\nwere mangy with overeating, and the buzzards so gorged they could\\nnot move out of our way.” from this expedition he brought back many\\nornaments of gold manufactured before the christian era, and made\\nseveral valuable maps of hitherto uncharted regions. it was in\\nrecognition of the information gathered by him on this trip that he was\\nelected a fellow of the royal geographical society.\\n\\nhe returned to rhodesia in time to take part in the second matabele\\nrebellion. this was in 1896. by now burnham was a very prominent\\nmember of the “vortrekers” and pioneers at buluwayo, and sir frederick\\ncarrington, who was in command of the forces, attached him to his staff.\\nthis second outbreak was a more serious uprising than the one of 1893,\\nand as it was evident the forces of the chartered company could not\\nhandle it, imperial troops were sent to assist them. but with even their\\naid the war dragged on until it threatened to last to the rainy season,\\nwhen the troops must have gone into winter quarters. had they done so,\\nthe cost of keeping them would have fallen on the chartered company,\\nalready a sufferer in pocket from the ravages of the rinderpest and the\\nexpenses of the investigation which followed the jameson raid.\\n\\naccordingly, carrington looked about for some measure by which he could\\nbring the war to an immediate end.\\n\\nit was suggested to him by a young colonial, named armstrong, the\\ncommissioner of the district, that this could be done by destroying\\nthe “god,” or high priest, umlimo, who was the chief inspiration of the\\nrebellion.\\n\\nthis high priest had incited the rebels to a general massacre of women\\nand children, and had given them confidence by promising to strike the\\nwhite soldiers blind and to turn their bullets into water. armstrong\\nhad discovered the secret hiding-place of umlimo, and carrington ordered\\nburnham to penetrate the enemy’s lines, find the god, capture him, and\\nif that were not possible to destroy him.\\n\\nthe adventure was a most desperate one. umlimo was secreted in a cave\\non the top of a huge kopje. at the base of this was a village where were\\ngathered two regiments, of a thousand men each, of his fighting men.\\n\\nfor miles around this village the country was patrolled by roving bands\\nof the enemy.\\n\\nagainst a white man reaching the cave and returning, the chances were a\\nhundred to one, and the difficulties of the journey are illustrated by\\nthe fact that burnham and armstrong were unable to move faster than at\\nthe rate of a mile an hour. in making the last mile they consumed three\\nhours. when they reached the base of the kopje in which umlimo was\\nhiding, they concealed their ponies in a clump of bushes, and on hands\\nand knees began the ascent.\\n\\ndirectly below them lay the village, so close that they could smell the\\nodors of cooking from the huts, and hear, rising drowsily on the hot,\\nnoonday air, voices of the warriors. for minutes at a time they lay as\\nmotionless as the granite bowlders around or squirmed and crawled over\\nloose stones which a miss of hand or knee would have dislodged and sent\\nclattering into the village. after an hour of this tortuous climbing\\nthe cave suddenly opened before them, and they beheld umlimo.\\nburnham recognized that to take him alive from his stronghold was an\\nimpossibility, and that even they themselves would leave the place was\\nequally doubtful. so, obeying orders, he fired, killing the man who had\\nboasted he would turn the bullets of his enemies into water. the echo of\\nthe shot aroused the village as would a stone hurled into an ant-heap.\\nin an instant the veldt below was black with running men, and as,\\nconcealment being no longer possible, the white men rose to fly a great\\nshout of anger told them they were discovered. at the same moment two\\nwomen, returning from a stream where they had gone for water, saw the\\nponies, and ran screaming to give the alarm. the race that followed\\nlasted two hours, for so quickly did the kaffirs spread out on every\\nside that it was impossible for burnham to gain ground in any one\\ndirection, and he was forced to dodge, turn, and double. at one time\\nthe white men were driven back to the very kopje from which the race had\\nstarted.\\n\\nbut in the end they evaded assegai and gunfire, and in safety reached\\nbuluwayo. this exploit was one of the chief factors in bringing the war\\nto a close. the matabeles, finding their leader was only a mortal like\\nthemselves, and so could not, as he had promised, bring miracles to\\ntheir aid, lost heart, and when cecil rhodes in person made overtures of\\npeace, his terms were accepted. during the hard days of the siege, when\\nrations were few and bad, burnham’s little girl, who had been the first\\nwhite child born in buluwayo, died of fever and lack of proper\\nfood. this with other causes led him to leave rhodesia and return to\\ncalifornia. it is possible he then thought he had forever turned\\nhis back on south africa, but, though he himself had departed, the\\nimpression he had made there remained behind him.\\n\\nburnham did not rest long in california. in alaska the hunt for gold had\\njust begun, and, the old restlessness seizing him, he left pasadena and\\nher blue skies, tropical plants, and trolley-car strikes for the new raw\\nland of the klondike. with burnham it has always been the place that is\\nbeing made, not the place in being, that attracts. he has helped to make\\nstraight the ways of several great communities--arizona, california,\\nrhodesia, alaska, and uganda. as he once said: “it is the constructive\\nside of frontier life that most appeals to me, the building up of a\\ncountry, where you see the persistent drive and force of the white man;\\nwhen the place is finally settled i don’t seem to enjoy it very long.”\\n\\nin alaska he did much prospecting, and, with a sled and only two dogs,\\nfor twenty-four days made one long fight against snow and ice, covering\\nsix hundred miles. in mining in alaska he succeeded well, but against\\nthe country he holds a constant grudge, because it kept him out of the\\nfight with spain. when war was declared he was in the wilds and knew\\nnothing of it, and though on his return to civilization he telegraphed\\ncolonel roosevelt volunteering for the rough riders, and at once started\\nsouth, by the time he had reached seattle the war was over.\\n\\nseveral times has he spoken to me of how bitterly he regretted missing\\nthis chance to officially fight for his country. that he had twice\\nserved with english forces made him the more keen to show his loyalty to\\nhis own people.\\n\\nthat he would have been given a commission in the rough riders seems\\nevident from the opinion president roosevelt has publicly expressed of\\nhim.\\n\\n“i know burnham,” the president wrote in 1901. “he is a scout and a\\nhunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot,\\nand a fighter. he is the ideal scout, and when enlisted in the military\\nservice of any country he is bound to be of the greatest benefit.”\\n\\nthe truth of this burnham was soon to prove.\\n\\nin 1899 he had returned to the klondike, and in january of 1900 had been\\nsix months in skagway. in that same month lord roberts sailed for\\ncape town to take command of the army, and with him on his staff was\\nburnham’s former commander, sir frederick, now lord, carrington. one\\nnight as the ship was in the bay of biscay, carrington was talking of\\nburnham and giving instances of his marvellous powers as a “tracker.”\\n\\n“he is the best scout we ever had in south africa!” carrington declared.\\n\\n“then why don’t we get him back there?” said roberts.\\n\\nwhat followed is well known.\\n\\nfrom gibraltar a cable was sent to skagway, offering burnham the\\nposition, created especially for him, of chief of scouts of the british\\narmy in the field.\\n\\nprobably never before in the history of wars has one nation paid so\\npleasant a tribute to the abilities of a man of another nation.\\n\\nthe sequel is interesting. the cablegram reached skagway by the steamer\\n_city of seattle_. the purser left it at the post-office, and until two\\nhours and a half before the steamer was listed to start on her return\\ntrip, there it lay. then burnham, in asking for his mail, received it.\\nin two hours and a half he had his family, himself, and his belongings\\non board the steamer, and had started on his half-around-the-world\\njourney from alaska to cape town.\\n\\na skagway paper of january 5, 1900, published the day after burnham\\nsailed, throws a side light on his character. after telling of his hasty\\ndeparture the day before, and of the high compliment that had been paid\\nto “a prominent skagwayan,” it adds: “although mr. burnham has lived in\\nskagway since last august, and has been north for many months, he has\\nsaid little of his past, and few have known that he is the man famous\\nover the world as ‘the american scout’ of the matabele wars.”\\n\\nmany a man who went to the klondike did not, for reasons best known to\\nhimself, talk about his past. but it is characteristic of burnham that,\\nthough he lived there two years, his associates did not know, until the\\nbritish government snatched him from among them, that he had not always\\nbeen a prospector like themselves.\\n\\ni was on the same ship that carried burnham the latter half of his\\njourney, from southampton to cape town, and every night for seventeen\\nnights was one of a group of men who shot questions at him. and it was\\ninteresting to see a fellow-countryman one had heard praised so highly\\nso completely make good. it was not as though he had a credulous\\naudience of commercial tourists. among the officers who each evening\\ngathered around him were colonel gallilet of the egyptian cavalry,\\ncaptain frazer commanding the scotch gillies, captain mackie of lord\\nroberts’s staff, each of whom was later killed in action; colonel sir\\ncharles hunter of the royal rifles, major bagot, major lord dudley, and\\ncaptain lord valentia. each of these had either held command in border\\nfights in india or the sudan or had hunted big game, and the questions\\neach asked were the outcome of his own experience and observation.\\n\\nnot for a single evening could a faker have submitted to the midnight\\nexamination through which they put burnham and not have exposed his\\nignorance. they wanted to know what difference there is in a column of\\ndust raised by cavalry and by trek wagons, how to tell whether a horse\\nthat has passed was going at a trot or a gallop, the way to throw a\\ndiamond hitch, how to make a fire without at the same time making a\\ntarget of yourself, how--why--what--and how?\\n\\nand what made us most admire burnham was that when he did not know he at\\nonce said so.\\n\\nwithin two nights he had us so absolutely at his mercy that we would\\nhave followed him anywhere; anything he chose to tell us, we would have\\naccepted. we were ready to believe in flying foxes, flying squirrels,\\nthat wild turkeys dance quadrilles--even that you must never sleep in\\nthe moonlight. had he demanded: “do you believe in vampires?” we would\\nhave shouted “yes.” to ask that a scout should on an ocean steamer prove\\nhis ability was certainly placing him under a severe handicap.\\n\\nas one of the british officers said: “it’s about as fair a game as\\nthough we planted the captain of this ship in the sahara desert, and\\ntold him to prove he could run a ten-thousand-ton liner.”\\n\\nburnham continued with lord roberts to the fall of pretoria, when he was\\ninvalided home.\\n\\nduring the advance north he was a hundred times inside the boer laagers,\\nkeeping headquarters staff daily informed of the enemy’s movements; was\\ntwice captured and twice escaped.\\n\\nhe was first captured while trying to warn the british from the fatal\\ndrift at thaba’nchu. when reconnoitring alone in the morning mist he\\ncame upon the boers hiding on the banks of the river, toward which the\\nenglish were even then advancing. the boers were moving all about him,\\nand cut him off from his own side. he had to choose between abandoning\\nthe english to the trap or signalling to them, and so exposing himself\\nto capture. with the red kerchief the scouts carried for that purpose he\\nwigwagged to the approaching soldiers to turn back, that the enemy were\\nawaiting them. but the column, which was without an advance guard, paid\\nno attention to his signals and plodded steadily on into the ambush,\\nwhile burnham was at once made prisoner. in the fight that followed he\\npretended to receive a wound in the knee and bound it so elaborately\\nthat not even a surgeon would have disturbed the carefully arranged\\nbandages. limping heavily and groaning with pain, he was placed in\\na trek wagon with the officers who really were wounded, and who, in\\nconsequence, were not closely guarded. burnham told them who he was and,\\nas he intended to escape, offered to take back to head-quarters their\\nnames or any messages they might wish to send to their people. as\\ntwenty yards behind the wagon in which they lay was a mounted guard, the\\nofficers told him escape was impossible. he proved otherwise. the trek\\nwagon was drawn by sixteen oxen and driven by a kaffir boy. later in the\\nevening, but while it still was moonlight, the boy descended from his\\nseat and ran forward to belabor the first spans of oxen. this was the\\nopportunity for which burnham had been waiting.\\n\\nslipping quickly over the driver’s seat, he dropped between the two\\n“wheelers” to the disselboom, or tongue, of the trek wagon. from this he\\nlowered himself and fell between the legs of the oxen on his back in the\\nroad. in an instant the body of the wagon had passed over him, and while\\nthe dust still hung above the trail he rolled rapidly over into the\\nditch at the side of the road and lay motionless.\\n\\nit was four days before he was able to re-enter the british lines,\\nduring which time he had been lying in the open veldt, and had subsisted\\non one biscuit and two handfuls of “mealies,” or what we call indian\\ncorn.\\n\\nanother time when out scouting he and his kaffir boy while on foot were\\n“jumped” by a boer commando and forced to hide in two great ant-hills.\\nthe boers went into camp on every side of them, and for two days,\\nunknown to themselves, held burnham a prisoner. only at night did he and\\nthe cape boy dare to crawl out to breathe fresh air and to eat the food\\ntablets they carried in their pockets. on five occasions was burnham\\nsent into the boer lines with dynamite cartridges to blow up the\\nrailroad over which the enemy was receiving supplies and ammunition. one\\nof these expeditions nearly ended his life.\\n\\non june 2, 1901, while trying by night to blow up the line between\\npretoria and delagoa bay, he was surrounded by a party of boers and\\ncould save himself only by instant flight. he threw himself indian\\nfashion along the back of his pony, and had all but got away when a\\nbullet caught the horse and, without even faltering in its stride, it\\ncrashed to the ground dead, crushing burnham beneath it and knocking him\\nsenseless. he continued unconscious for twenty-four hours, and when he\\ncame to, both friends and foes had departed. bent upon carrying out his\\norders, although suffering the most acute agony, he crept back to the\\nrailroad and destroyed it. knowing the explosion would soon bring the\\nboers, on his hands and knees he crept to an empty kraal, where for\\ntwo days and nights he lay insensible. at the end of that time he\\nappreciated that he was sinking and that unless he found aid he would\\ndie.\\n\\naccordingly, still on his hands and knees, he set forth toward the sound\\nof distant firing. he was indifferent as to whether it came from the\\nenemy or his own people, but, as it chanced, he was picked up by a\\npatrol of general dickson’s brigade, who carried him to pretoria. there\\nthe surgeons discovered that in his fall he had torn apart the muscles\\nof the stomach and burst a blood-vessel. that his life was saved, so\\nthey informed him, was due only to the fact that for three days he had\\nbeen without food. had he attempted to digest the least particle of the\\n“staff of life” he would have surely died. his injuries were so serious\\nthat he was ordered home.\\n\\non leaving the army he was given such hearty thanks and generous rewards\\nas no other american ever received from the british war office. he was\\npromoted to the rank of major, presented with a large sum of money, and\\nfrom lord roberts received a personal letter of thanks and appreciation.\\n\\nin part the field-marshal wrote: “i doubt if any other man in the force\\ncould have successfully carried out the thrilling enterprises in which\\nfrom time to time you have been engaged, demanding as they did the\\ntraining of a lifetime, combined with exceptional courage, caution, and\\npowers of endurance.” on his arrival in england he was commanded to dine\\nwith the queen and spend the night at osborne, and a few months later,\\nafter her death, king edward created him a member of the distinguished\\nservice order, and personally presented him with the south african\\nmedal with five bars, and the cross of the d. s. o. while recovering\\nhis health burnham, with mrs. burnham, was “passed on” by friends he had\\nmade in the army from country house to country house; he was made the\\nguest of honor at city banquets, with the duke of rutland rode after the\\nbelvoir hounds, and in scotland made mild excursions after grouse. but\\nafter six months of convalescence he was off again, this time to the\\nhinterland of ashanti, on the west coast of africa, where he went in the\\ninterests of a syndicate to investigate a concession for working gold\\nmines.\\n\\nwith his brother-in-law, j. c. blick, he marched and rowed twelve\\nhundred miles, and explored the volta river, at that date so little\\nvisited that in one day’s journey they counted eleven hippopotamuses. in\\njuly, 1901, he returned from ashanti, and a few months later an unknown\\nbut enthusiastic admirer asked in the house of commons if it were\\ntrue major burnham had applied for the post of instructor of scouts at\\naldershot. there is no such post, and burnham had not applied for\\nany other post. to the timer he wrote: “i never have thought myself\\ncompetent to teach britons how to fight, or to act as an instructor\\nwith officers who have fought in every corner of the world. the question\\nasked in parliament was entirely without my knowledge, and i deeply\\nregret that it was asked.” a few months later, with mrs. burnham and his\\nyounger son, bruce, he journeyed to east africa as director of the east\\nafrican syndicate.\\n\\nduring his stay there the _african review_ said of him: “should east\\nafrica ever become a possession for england to be proud of, she will owe\\nmuch of her prosperity to the brave little band that has faced hardships\\nand dangers in discovering her hidden resources. major burnham has\\nchosen men from england, ireland, the united states, and south africa\\nfor sterling qualities, and they have justified his choice. not the\\nleast like a hero is the retiring, diffident little major himself,\\nthough a finer man for a friend or a better man to serve under would not\\nbe found in the five continents.”\\n\\nburnham explored a tract of land larger than germany, penetrating a\\nthousand miles through a country, never before visited by white men,\\nto the borders of the congo basin. with him he had twenty white men and\\nfive hundred natives. the most interesting result of the expedition\\nwas the discovery of a lake forty-nine miles square, composed almost\\nentirely of pure carbonate of soda, forming a snowlike crust so thick\\nthat on it the men could cross the lake.\\n\\nit is the largest, and when the railroad is built--the uganda railroad\\nis now only eighty-eight miles distant--it will be the most valuable\\ndeposit of carbonate of soda ever found.\\n\\na year ago, in the interests of john hays hammond, the distinguished\\nmining engineer of south africa and this country, burnham went to\\nsonora, mexico, to find a buried city and to open up mines of copper and\\nsilver.\\n\\nbesides seeking for mines, hammond and burnham, with gardner williams,\\nanother american who also made his fortune in south africa, are working\\ntogether on a scheme to import to this country at their own expense many\\nspecies of south african deer.\\n\\nthe south african deer is a hardy animal and can live where the american\\ndeer cannot, and the idea in importing him is to prevent big game in\\nthis country from passing away. they have asked congress to set aside\\nfor these animals a portion of the forest reserve. already congress has\\nvoted toward the plan $15,000, and president roosevelt is one of its\\nmost enthusiastic supporters.\\n\\nwe cannot leave burnham in better hands than those of hammond and\\ngardner williams. than these three men the united states has not sent to\\nbritish africa any americans of whom she has better reason to be proud.\\nsuch men abroad do for those at home untold good. they are the real\\nambassadors of their country.\\n\\nthe last i learned of burnham is told in the snapshot of him which\\naccompanies this article, and which shows him, barefoot, in the yaqui\\nriver, where he has gone, perhaps, to conceal his trail from the\\nindians. it came a month ago in a letter which said briefly that when\\nthe picture was snapped the expedition was “trying to cool off.” there\\nhis narrative ended. promising as it does adventures still to come, it\\nseems a good place in which to leave him.\\n\\nmeanwhile, you may think of mrs. burnham after a year in mexico keeping\\nthe house open for her husband’s return to pasadena, and of their first\\nson, roderick, studying woodcraft with his father, forestry with gifford\\npinchot, and playing right guard on the freshman team at the university\\nof california.\\n\\nbut burnham himself we will leave “cooling off” in the yaqui river,\\nmaybe, with indians hunting for him along the banks. and we need not\\nworry about him. we know they will not catch him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nend of project gutenberg’s real soldiers of fortune, by richard harding davis\\n\\n*** end of this project gutenberg ebook real soldiers of
